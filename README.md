Build and run instructions:

git clone https://github.com/Sembiance/kotrd.git
cd kotrd
cd src
make
cd ../area
./startup.sh

Then you can telnet into 5000 :)

Note that after running ./startup.sh it just sits there. No output to screen, the program doesn't exit.
So just try connecting to port 5000 or check the logs to see what's up.
