BlackSun~ {DBLACKSUN~
none~ none~
The BlackSun area very dark and mysterious clan.  They consider
themselves the more outlandish types.  They are most content to spend time
ammong themselves, gathering and hoarding treasure.  They worship the dark
and evil gods, but are very passive.  Since they shy away from contact with
other creatures besides themselves they only fight when backed in to a
cornor, and occasionally when they see a piece of eq they would like to own
for themselves.

dynasty~ {CDynasty{x~
none~ none~
Dynasty are searching for power.  Their ultimate goal is to become the
most powerfull person in the land.  They are mildly selfish and dont like to
work together.  Although they worship the gods of good they will go to any
length to become powerfull.  If it suites them they will kill a person in
coldblood, yet return to their hall and worship the most angelic gods in the
realm.  The gods notice this and because of it do not look down strongly
upon them, and they dont havea very good reputation with other clans.

unity~ {bUnity{x~
none~ none~
Unity is a clan united to become one and and to become a very powerfull
clan.  They are neither Evil nor Good but fall somewhere in between.  They
work together, and help eachother whenever it is needed.  They have no
strong morals, and work towards no one goal.  They believe that by following
their own paths they will be able to help Unity strive.  You will find
everyone from cold blooded assasins to holy clerics in the ranks of Unity. 
No one gets down on anyone else, and just lets whatever happens happen.

Legacy~ {gLEGACY~
none~ none~
This is a Non-Player Killing Clan.  What this means is that the members
of this clan can neither be killed by a player or kill a player.  The
members of this clan have a lot of expectations from the imms.  They are
expected to be model players.  This means that they must be able to be
looked up to by newbies, and can NEVER break any rules.  Breaking a rule is
cause for being kicked out of the clan.  They must be able to work together
with, and get along with other members of the clan.  Every members is
expected to help anyone they can, especially newbies.  All members must be
good Role Players, or at least attempt to Role Play, this is very important.
Joining this clan is extremely difficult as there are only 5 members.  The
only way to join is if one of the 5 quits or gets kicked out of the clan. 
This is NOT a way for people to get the benefits of being in a clan without
being player killed.  Caroman and Lybre keep a very close watch over the
clan and make sure everyone is following the guidelines.  As with any clan
you must be between levels 20 and 40 to join, there are no
race/class/alignment restrictions.
