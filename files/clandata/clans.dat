 {DWe all have those moments where reality seems to be dissonant with what we expect to happen.
    Sometimes we get enjoyment in letting that moment pass over us, as we realize this does not happen often.
    For all adventurers searching for experience, the sublimity of that moment of {rUniquenesS{D is known.
    A {RCu{Dl{RT{D of followers emerges that searches rampantly for that moment of strange {mwonder{D.
    They are so addicted to being in touch with that feeling, and the {wTimelessnesS{D of
    sartoric {MBeautY{D that occurs in that moment, they seek to recreate it for themselves, in any way.
    Their actions may seem unconventional and {RO{rd{RD{D to others, and sometimes downright {crepulsive{D,
    but in the end, their motives are not so different.
    Sometimes that moment can totally take over one's {CMinD{D and {WSpiriT{D, and they
    let themselves be victim to {RTorrentiaL{D thought and irrevocably illogical action.
    {RC{rh{Da{Wo{RS{D emerges. Things are not as they seem, and we seek to keep it that way.{x

Crimson Knights~ {RCr{rims{Ron{x~

{xClan {RCr{rims{Ron {rKn{Righ{rts {xis forged in the belief that the
most brilliant of diamonds are made from the roughest of coal.  In
accordance with this belief, the leader wanders through the world in search
of men and women with the truest of personalities, the quickest of wits, and
the rawest of skill.  If those people choose to join they are given to the
Master Healer {rDurendal{x for training to become {RCr{rims{Ron
{rKn{Righ{rts{x.  {RCr{rims{Ron {rKn{Righ{rts{x value skill, intelligence,
honor, and loyalty.  Clan members should always strive to better themselves
as well as fellow members.  Our motto is "{BA squad is as strong as its
weakest knight.  {x" So increasing the skill and power of the {RCr{rims{Ron
{rKn{Righ{rts{x is a every day job.  With this strength of unity, the
{RCr{rims{Ron {rKn{Righ{rts{x stand as a unbreakable phalanx of warriors
against any threat that may arise.
