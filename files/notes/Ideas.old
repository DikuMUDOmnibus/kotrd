I know I'm gonna get killed for this, but really the problem with
the classes is that they were created (by someone other than Sembi)
with no real definition in mind. If we want to fix classes and
do it right, they ALL need to be overhauled, not just Psis,
not just remorts, but each and every one of them, from the ground
up
 
That's all I am gonna say on this topic for now, before angry
mobs of players come and try to kill me...

Remort classes on their own aren't much stronger than the others. The reason
you have the perception that they are is because they are always
played as Remorts - meaning they always have an additional classes'

this discussion is completely pointless, lets look at the facts:
first, remort only classes exist to REWARD players
so you should be asking to have them powered up not removed
if you truely do believe that they are not more powerful
 
second, your arguement is based upon class combos
i wracked my brain to come up with a combo you cant do
I realized one: ranger/psi
anyone and everyone who knows will tell you such a combo aint great
 
finally, it really does seem to me that, considering your situation
you are trying to make the arguement so that you can
have a remort only class without earning it
i suggest you obtaining a remort hero or two like the rest of us
and then when you have proven you understand the remort system
you can make a more sensible arguement

I would like to say, to some degree i agree with spatula.
Remort classes should be implemented as a reward for people reaching that stage.
Perhaps they do need powering up, i cannot say for sure
I do understand that psi's got it pretty good though, i think..hehe
I don't know how fair it would be to increase the power of remort classes now
The people who have already remorted based on current class stats
might feel like they're getting the shaft...but then again, life's not fair
 
Finally, it almost doesn't seem like rangers are pwerful enough....ALONE...
however, paired up with a cleric or a warrior class, i can see pretty good
potential
Especially since whirlwind is supposedly stronger than circle:)
 
BTW, this style of note writing annoys me too...hehe...
the boards are all right, but there should be a word wrap feature and/or
A way to remove lines...i can't see anyway to do that now

The skill gives thieves one more attack for a

Contemplating how many hpts you get per level, it

Here are some new commands I thought would make the gameplay smoother.
{x
For instance, you can buy a certain number of items from a shopkeeper
by typing "buy #*healing potion".  But say you put all of them in your back
pack for future use, and then you want to use only a certain number of the
potions in any given situation.  You must take ALL of the healing potions out
one by one in order to use them.  I propose the idea of making a command so that
you can take out a certain number of objects in your container, without having
to take ALL of them out.  It can be as simple as "get/take #*healing backpack".
I hope you can understand that.
{x
Second, how about a command to see the HP percentage of a mobile without
having to attack the mob, or guess from just what it says in the description.
"Glance" or maybe another form of examine could work in this situation.
{x
Third, I suggest a way to empty a liquid container.  A command such as "empty"
could very well make things run smoother when players wish to empty a liquid
contents of container.

Subject rare armor~

Wouldn't it be nice to have on certain mobs rare armor drop off of them? 
Would bring a more interesting sprig of livelyness to it!
The rare armor would be really nice, and certain level mobs drops certain level
Rare armor
 
Just a thought,

Subject silent emptiness~
Text
Divia came back? and I wasnt around to see it?
well, it seems to me like we do have willing players here
only thing is, none of us want to be here alone.  well, 
I would be here alone, but I end up spending WAAY to much
time here and ultimately I really do need a life, 
the fact that I havent got one only makes it more important
that I get one.  
 
well, I offer a truce:  I will try and check in nightly
around 7 pm ET.  I will stick around for an hour or so,
if anyone else wants to be around good, if another time
is better for someone, let me know, an Ill see what can
be done.
 
seems to me, if we sort of band together on this, we can
plan to be here at similar times, and thusly we might be
able to enjoy the mud again.

Hey bro, called you and left a message. I'm on nightly around 5-9 ish CST,
let me know when you get day off when you're just doing laundry or 
something so we can jam out.
I'm going to leave a new note to everyone, because we have Loki playing her
here* again, as Sawdust. There are a bunch of newbies that pop on all hours.
The mud may have no immortals but the game is not dead.
Peace!
