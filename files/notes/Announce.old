Subject EQ Changes~
Text
Alot of the weapons have been changed, most of them the average
has been upped. I suggest replacing your weapon and sacrificing your old
one just to see if your weapon has changed, since Im not sure if the
changes will auto affect weapons while logged off.
 
I will eventually get to all the eq on the mud but it will be an ongoing process
so please be patient.
 
Also I found out that all the weights on eq are in tenths, so if an item
has a weight of 35, its actual weight is 3.5lbs... 40, 4lbs ect.
with this in mind the weight on every piece of eq will most likely be changed.
This will also take some time. An average dagger weights about 2.5 lbs. I know
cause I have one with an 8 inch blade and a fairley sturdy hilt.
I figure most old time blades were about this long, generally speaking.
So...as time passes, most of your dual combonations will change. Some have
already with the most recent changes.

Subject Segment/Join Instructions~
Text
A new segment/join system is in place!
You now have ultimate flexibility in creating objects capable of being joined
to other objects.
The new system works by adding extra descriptions to objects.
{x
First, an item is looked at to be joinable if it has an extra description
with a title of  =segment=
{x
The format of this extra description is:
joinswith <vnum> [creates <vnum>]
TO CHAR JOIN MESSAGE
GOES HERE ON 
MULTIPLE LINES
TERMINATED WITH
`
TO ROOM JOIN MESSAGE
GOES HERE ON
MULTIPLE LINES
TERMINATED WITH
`
{x
The first line must have joinswith <vnum> at the least.
The next lines are said to the CHAR when they join the object.
Use the ` character to say your done with that text.
The next few lines are said to the ROOM the char is in when they join.
Again, use the ` character to say your done.
{x
The creates <vnum> part is OPTIONAL.
If you have this, then as soon as two objects are joined together
they both dissapear and the vnum is created in their place.
{x
If you don't have a creates vnum then they are just joined and
the message is sent out but no obejcts are destroyed.
{x
Let's say you wanted to join a bare tootsie (vnum 1960) with a 
tootsie wrapper (vnum 1961) to create a tootsie roll (vnum 1963).
(These objects exist on the mud, edit them to see how they work)
{x
On the bare tootsie, add an extra description called  =segment=
In it put:
joinswith 1961 creates 1963
You roll a $p with $P and creates a tootsie roll!
`
$n rolls a $p with $P and creates a tootsie roll!
`
{x
$p is the name of the first object
$P is the name of the second object
$n is the name of the person doing the joining.
These can go anywhere you want in the text.
{x
In 1961 you would not put ANYTHING at all.
No =segment= code at all.
Neither would anything go in 1963.
{x
It's that simple.
{x
But let's say you wanted something more complex.
How about wanting the user to 'join' 5 candles with a special
candelabra, and then have something happen after all 5 have been joined.
I have done this on the mud, so you can look at those objects for examples.
The 5 candle vnums are 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955.
The candelabra they are joined with is vnum 1950.
{x
Each candle has a =segment= extra description looking like:
joinswith 1950
You insert $p into $P
`
$n inserts $p into $P
`
{x
That simple!
{x
But how does anything happen when all 5 are joined?
For this you go to the target object, 1950 and add a =segment= extra desc.
Here is what goes in that one:
ifjoinedwith 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 creates 1956
You insert all the candles into $p!
There is an amazing flash of light and a bracelet appears on the floor.
`
$n inserts all 5 candles into $p!!
***** THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT *****
A small bracelet appears on the floor.
`
{x
Notice I have introduced a new command 'ifjoinedwith'
The format is: ifjoinedwith <vnum> [...] <[creates <vnum>]>
{x
Notice I have all 5 candle vnums up there.
And it creates vnum 1956 (which is a key).
When all 5 candles are joined with this, all the joined objects vanish.
The MAIN object doesn't vanish though. (soon I will have a flag to allow
the main object to vanish too, but right now it doesnt, only the objects
that were joined to it vanish).
Again the first text goes to the char, and the second text goes to the room.
{x
Let me know if anyone has any questions.
{x
Oh, don't use the ITEM_SEGMENT's item type anymore.

Subject Some Hardcore Info~
Text
Just to give you all a little more Hardcore info.
If you choose to play Hardcore, you start collecting 'top list'
statistics at regular level 50.
Normal players (non-hardcore) can't start collecting until
they are a remort hero. So another reason to be hardcore :)
 
Also, if you die, and go back to level 1, you don't lost anything.
You keep your trains, pracs, HP, Mana, Moves. You just lose your XP and level.
But you won't gain trains, pracs, HP or Mana again until you've
past the level you died at before.
{x
Also, if you die at level 100, you only go back to level 75.
If your a Level 100 hardcore Legend, then you don't lose anything for dying.
~
