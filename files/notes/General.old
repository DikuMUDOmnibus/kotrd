I was thinking maybe of overhauling the Races and Classes.
Please post notes to ALL about what changes you think need made
to balance the classes. Also I am thinking of making it so
that it doesnt matter what class you go first or second 
when you remort, like if you are a mage, and go warrior
you get the maxium amound of charmies, rather than the min.
What do you guys think?

I say we make most Psi spells self only again.
That way their god-like AC, and complete heal
would once again balance them into the game again.
As of now... You just need one 'slave' Psi per
group to pump up the rest.  That just doesn't
seem right for a remort class.

this isnt really an idea, its more of a personal complaint
i would have posted it under personal, but then i couldnt send it to everyone
i would like some feed back from others on this
 
okay, i HATE the new board system, let me try to explain why:
first, and foremost: this line too long rejected?
like, why cant it word wrap? why do I have count the characters?
it is encouraging me to think discontinuously
 
also, this whole switching from one board to another?
i dont get that, maybe it will come with time
 
how do i remove lines i messed up without starting the whole thing over?
how do i do ANYTHING other than write a note in the middle of writing a note?
 
thats all i can think of for now
if anyone else has thoughts on this, i would like to hear from everyone

Subject Remorting~
Text
One of the biggest complaints about remorting is
the loss of hours, and such.  Why should someone
that stuck around at hero for 200 hours be the same
as some assassin who remorted in 20?  In any case,
perhaps we could scatter special 'items' about the
mud in most of the areas people XP in as they reach
100.  (e.g. creation, new thalos, cloudy mountain etc)
As the items are collected they will equal something
nifty like a 'crystal ball' that might 'capture your
spirit' ... The idea is that when someone remorts,
if they took the time to find these items and so forth
then they will be granted an extra 20 or 30 hours upon
remorting to give them a boost. :) That, plus the 40%
of hours you keep when remorting... It should -really-
balance out the XP well.
 
Of course, you might argue XP is fine, and why make
it easier for people to remort hero... But hey, It's
just an idea. :) Thanks everyone!

Text
Hmm... I must say, being able to keep 40% of yer hours from first class,
is a huge bonus as it stands.
lets say someone does have 200 hours, 40% of that is 80 hours isnt it?
WOW, awesome xp through that slightly tough lvl 15-30 or so region...
But then again, the person who did it in 20, only gets 8 hours.....
in the end, it seems to balance out in remort class...
and, btw, i haven't seen anyone hero in 20 hours:P
i heard something like it's been done, but not recently, not to that extreme.
 
this is just my opinion in the end.  I dont think we should get carried away..
Lets see what 40% does... i beleive it'll help greatly:)

Subject RE:class/Races~
Text
It seems that the way it is the only classes that suffer losses on 
remort are the spellcasters.  Gate/Summon become weakened
and of course the charmie thing.  Whereas assassinate/circle
still hit just as hard.  This does discourage people from being
mage first mort.  
As for the other classes, circle is maybe too powerful?
Critical Strike is definately too weak.  
Companion allows you to summon a pet for 150 mana, but
doesnt consider the amount of mana you have, allowing you to
do this even if you are already at negative mana.  Also, if
your companion dies in combat and has a spirit show up
the spirit is of the type (No short Description).  Looks really
strange when this happens.
Psi should get the identify spell.  Really in my opinion, everyone
should get this.  Complete heal is too powerful for PK.  One need
only flee starting at around 40% to ensure that one can never be
Pked as a psi.  I propose a limit to the number of times complete 
heal can be cast in a short period.  Like perhaps make it so complete
heal can only be cast once per tick.  
More later, i gotta think about it some.

I have been trying to think of something to reward those of
us with ridiculous amounts of hours.  I noticed a strange
fact, the maximum number of items held varies for each 
of my remort heros.  From as low as 153 to as high as
173.  Anyway, how about givin a bonus to max items
carried based on hours.  I think that would be cool
and would not affect the balance of the mud.

Subject Classes~

Personally, i think it'd make things alot more interesting if classes could keep
their "original strengths" of spells or whatever, after they remort
I think it could at something new, and if anything make spellcasters
a little stronger, which some people say they need to be.
 
Also, i think warriors are a little lacking:). besides 4th attack,
(which can be parried/dodged/etc) and bash, i dont think they got much else
to seperate them from all the other classes.  
Maybe give em the ability to dual wield heavier weapons, or be able to
dual wield a weapon of same weight as primary? y'know, since they're beefcakes:P
Or how bout some hr/dr modifier thats alot better than berserk?
Or improve bash.... But these are just some random thoughts.
And i'm not trying to single warriors out, or claim they need attention first.
 
Overall, I would like to redirect your attention/thoughts to allowing
classes to keep the strengths of their skills/spells the same as before
they remorted, or, in some cases, whichever class (remort or not) 
was/is more capable/gooder at casting the spell/using the skill.

more class specific, you will start to see a wider varity of eq on people
Im also hoping for open slots in all the eq to add gems and what not

To improve the mud appearance with gmud, you must:
Click on the Options->Font, select fixedsys (or any font)
next:
click on Options->Screen Wrap, select Wrap to screen, word
 
To make wrap work better you may want to select a smaller 
font size (10 or 11 instead of 12). Also usually works
better if you use regular instead of bold fonts...
 
Good luck,

P.S. obviously you can help screen wrap by enlarging

The only exit here is west, yet when I type west, it will not budge nor does it
recognize I have left or attempted to.  Please check on this whenenever
possible.

just a couple things about the gauntlet.. i like the
new prizes and spells on the equipment.. i just have 
a couple tips.. first BINGO doesnt register for gauntlet
im not bringing this up to get it fixed cause personally
i dont think it should work in the gauntlet.. but anyway
spirits can still come from dead gauntlet mobs.. i dont 
really like that.. if you kill the guy and are almost dead
and get killed by the spirit.. that would suck.. however
once you kill a guy you get the prize.. if you kill his
spirit you get 2.. i like that (worked for the PK pill
anyways).. last.. charmies dont exit with you in the last
room.. thats all..

Hey guys, you might remember a guy named Remus...
Well, IRL I got into a motorcycle assicdent..it wasn't pretty
I was riding home from class, when I was
broadsided by a runaway semi-truck
I've spent the past several months in the hospital and in 
physical rehabilitation and whatnot
Been forgetting a lot of stuff, but im told that should eventually stop
But i finally got to come home so
the past few days i have been working on getting my affairs back
in order, and i wanted to say
that i'll definetly be around again
unless of course venus decides to slay me for negligence
: )
Ok, well, i think i have said my piece..hopefully see everyone soon
Adieu,    Remus the broken

yea, so I am failing ALL of my classes this semester, which I do NOT

had mudding problems before, I can get obsessed with it, but I often feel
like this is really the only place where i fit in.  I don't know what to do, but
I guess I'm going to take a break from this place for a while, I really do hope
that all of you do well, I dunno how much I can really check back here without
the obsession kicking in again.  So, yeah, anyway if anyone wants to get in

Hello people!
It was a long time ago I was online. The reason for this is because of school
and my own little company. I liked this mud very much!
I don't like to go, but I have no choice.
It's not good to have a character, who will not come online
I don't have got the time to play this mud, I am very busy on the moment
and I really want to get finish my school and want to put
more time in my company. So I would like to thank
everybody who helped me! And that are a lot
I would like to thank the gods! Argon, Sembiance and Venus
I hope I did not forget one
Maybe I will come back, but that will be about a few years later
As last I would like Venus, who made this possible
And I hope her mud will be on for ever and will be the biggest
mud of them all! Because this is the coolest mud ever!!!
I don't delete myself now, I will do that next week or something
So I am very sorry and I wish you all the best!
On the last day I will give all my eq to a lucky one :D
Farwell world of the Phoenix... I will miss you...

A mud survives on two things, active players and active immortals.
We had active players, but we started lacking active immortals.
Less and less events, less and less immortals.
I saw it happening and I tried to help out by adding lots of code.
.h
Ignore the .h above hehe
The new code helped a bit, I think, but it wasn't enough
With no immortals, no events, no player-immortal interaction, no new areas.
 
I think that interaction between players and immortals always made muds special
 
Anyways, I don't have the time to invest into trying and get an immortal staff
together to try and bring the mud back.
The mud will continue to stay online, probably for decades as it's on my server.
But the web page is offline, because it was still being hosted by Venus
 
Sometimes I think about coding a new mud, something different and cool.
Because code is what I love to write.
But even a new and powerful type of mud won't matter without a lot
of time put into getting a staff to hold events and be part of the community.
 
Anyways, if anyone finds another mud out there that they just love playing
let me know, maybe I'll pop in and see if they want any code written :)
 
Maybe stones of wisdom or Acrophobia can find a new home somewhere :)

if i let anyone down, i'm sorry, i couldn't be here
as much as i wanted to, i couldn't be here
Most of you know what was going on, lets just say it
got a little more complicated
 I think everything should be back to a semblance of 
normalacy now though.
I'm not saying I'll be on a lot, but this is my home
It always has been, and always will be
I'll be on from time to time to say hi, see how things are going
and to do what i can to help Venus, Sembs, and any of the other imms 
to get this place bustling again
People grow tired of WOW, of Evercrack, and the other mmorpgs
They don't grow tired of Phoenix though. They just get too 
damn addicted. hehe...
If anyone is trying to get a hold of me, you can reach me here:

Hey,
What is the deal with exp? I'm always -1000 alignment and it fluctuates
wildly at times. For instance, the statues in N. Thalos are approx 30s. At 45,
they give approx. 20-30 xp but sometimes I will hit an 80 or 100. The same holds
true for other mobs too. The guards, soldiers, citizens in Cloudy Mountain
are much more difficult yet yield roughly the same exp at level 45(30-40) which
hardly seems worth the effort considering the 20 level lower statues take
one round to kill in comparison. Once again my alignment never changes and I
make sure to kill good alignned mobs. Why the random fluctuation and dislogic?

first time in a year that I spent more than a month without checking in.
good to see others have been around some, I would like to play more, 
but I wont sit here for hours and hours alone anymore, I have just done that
to death.
oh, and Kade, the exp works like this:
lvl 1-90 factors levels alignments and possible random bonus.
lvl 91-100 removes the alignment factor and greatly reduces overall exp.
near level 40 the alignment factor is more significant
although you can gain no exp (bugged) for levels too far below yours

My moving to boston won't affect the mud any Spatula :)
Mud will continue to stay up, though not sure why :)
The MUD is only getting about 1 to 5 connections per day
 
Once I see it go a whole month with no connections at all...
then I'll bring it down.
 
However I'll probably not even notice, I tend to forget it's running ;)

if you love us, including me, tell me where the remort portal is. I've searched
for days and then haven't played since the beginning of summer. I think we need 
to reconsider this whole remort portal idea and have someone submit a foolproof
yet challenging alterior.

I have been on here more recently, and I have seen a
few of you around too. I have seen some familiar people
and some new people, and everyone seems interested in
making this place more like it once was.  I am too.  
I will try to be here as often as I can, but classes just
started back up, so I will likely only be around between
10 and 12 pm eastern.  I will try to at least stop in
everyday, and I hope to see all of you!
I would really like to see some of our implementors, 
if at all possible.  We all miss you, and the mud NEEDS you.

I'm a lazy ass, and I request the location of the remort portal.
Its a small price to play to keep the playerbase up. And I looked for

if someone would drop a note as to its location. Personal please.
