first of all, i cant see envenom doing anything at all
i envenom my dagger and i do not kill anything any faster
nor do i see any status messages saying the enemies 
are being hurt by the poison
secondly, there is a bug with how envenom is checked
this is what i get every time i hit after i have envenomed my weapon
Your PIERCE injures the cityguard for 18 hp.
The poison on an electro-dagger has worn off.
but it hasnt because it says this when it is finally gone
The poison on an electro-dagger dries up.
so i dont know what that means that it has worn off but
i am assuming it means that it isnt working
so look into this if you wouldnt mind

Subject remorting~
Text
hey venus.. i was thinking about the third remort and i have some ideas
on how to become remort since you said the portal thing is up in the air.
maybe set up a remort store (kinda like portal store) but he is like quest
master and sends you on 4 seperate quests (all somewhat challenging) to find
4 peices of a key which you must join together to form a key to enter the 
'Third Remort Portal Room' with remort portal inside.. and maybe have each que
cost qp or make it so they need 4k or whatever qp to enter that room to remort.
also could work for 2nd remort too.. like cost 4k for this quest master to give
you hint on area and portal is free.. or any kind of combo like that.. 
but i definetly think it should be quest involved.. cause you know as well 
as i do that noone really likes the randomness of the portal.. im sure 90%
of remorts got immortal help to find the portal.. or maybe just me ;p
let me know what you think..

Hi Sembi,
   I'm missing a hollyphant tusk - so I did locate tusk and see that
one is carried by all hollyphant
unfortunately I never get it when I kill one.
I cast all detect spells and don't see it before attacking. Then when
I turn of autosac, there is no corpse... Even with a successful assassinate,
there is no corpse left behind - thus either it's a bug (that no corpse 
is generated), or it's a bug that one is supposed to be able to get
the tusk (in the item list for the area)>

Venus & Sembi --
 
I am sorry for my long absence.  I installed Service Pack 2 on my laptop
and my wifi has pretty much been screwed ever since.  It keeps kicking
off every minute or so, which is totally frustrating.  I just got back
from a 5-day stay at my sister's and hoped that my bro-in-law could sort
it out for me but so far it is the same as ever.  In the meantime I 
am seriously considering uninstalling the service pack since it has
basically done nothing but give me problems since day 1.
 
Anyway.
 
That is why I have not been around lately.  I was trying to find some
patch or online solution during my minute-long connections to the
internet, and Microsoft knowledgebase is exactly zero help. If either
of you have any clues how I might end my pain I would be glad to hear
it ;) In the meantime I will check in when I can, barring my now-typical
complications.

Subject anti-pals~
Text
Anti-pals are pretty much weak warriors - I have yet to get forsake 
to work on a mob (leveling) and I'm told it almost never works on 
players (pk), which is really their only good spell 
I do 2x the damage with trip than I do with forsake...
scratch that - I do 2x the damage with trip than harm
I have yet to get forsake to land
a-pals need something - forsake might be nice (tough to say
since I've never experienced it working on a tough mob)
if it would actually land.
looking at the class, it should have something that makes
it a desirable choice - it's got backstab, but thief 
ROCKS with circle... 
there is little offensive power to this class. Berserk
pays a harsh price (1/2 moves no matter how many that is)
so it'll unlikely ever get up to 100%, and gets +20/+20 
for the sacrifice.
I started this to understand what it can do, but I'm not 
convinced that there is much going for it...
I don't know how to improve it - it's pretty weak as a
spellcaster and it's pretty weak as a fighter.  If I could 
get forsake to work at a reasonable frequency I might feel 
different - that would be a start.  
then perhaps getting berserk a little more punch for the sacrifice 
so it would rock a bit more as a fighter (given it only has 3
attacks), but maybe forsake working better might be enough.
It's tough to tell without experiencing it.
Thanks for the great job!  I'm a alt of seclar - just trying to 
understand other classes...
Take care,

Hi Sembi,
   Also, assassinate works down to around 20% as do most
other skills like that.  Why does an anti-pals backstab
not work once it's been used once?
It's the only decent offensive weapon an antipal has
and it's incredibly weak due to that fact.  (can't 
flee can use it again, or as a remort get rescued, then
use it...

I was thinkin about bash for warriors.
Could you make it last between 2 OR 3 rounds on any 
mob or person who's not immune to bash?
It would could be 50/50 person chance of either 2 or
3 rounds. Also, it could prevent anyone from fleeing
WHILE they are stunned. And finally, if someone is
stunned, the number of mellee hits that actually
succeed could be drastically increased, from lets say
alot of parrying/dodging/shield blocking, to none.
At the same time, the chance of bash actually
landing/stunning a person could be decreased to
anywhere between 70-50% of the time, depending
on perhaps a few variables, such as size of basher
vs bashee, amount of hr/dr, and maybe even saves.
 
One other thing, could warriors get a skill thats stronger
than berserk? at lets say hero they could use it.
and it would give alot more hr/dr than berserk does.
 
 
I dunno what kinda paper work you'd have to go through
to get this approved, but hey, i thought i'd write a note
letting you know yer gettin fat. i mean.  i wuv you

the segment code for red forest appears to still have a few bugs
Here is what i did:  first i just started joinin the teeth without watchin
when i noticed that i had joined all the teeth i had and did NOT have
eight different shaft pieces.  So I logged on an alt that had all 16 teeth.
This is what i found:
white + silver = dark blue shaft piece
Black + Faerie = dark blue shaft piece
Brass + frost = light blue shaft piece
Emerald + Rainbow = light blue shaft piece
Green + Copper = pitch black shaft piece
Sapphire + Amethyst = pitch black shaft piece
Yellow + Gold = amber shaft piece
Crystal + Topaz = amber shaft piece
this leaves only four different shaft pieces, leaving out the white frosted, 
dark marroon, dark brown, and crimson.  I continued to join segments, 
the four shaft pieces joined to make 1/4 pieces of the hilt.  This is odd
because originally each of the four shaft peices should have joined with
one of the missing shaft pieces.  The 1/4 pieces joined to make the 1/2s
The 1/2s would not join.

Comparing all weapons level 80-100, trying to retain the original 
spirit of the weapon, some are obviously NOT meant to be great 
weapons.  Maintaining balance while improving the state of 
weapons on the mud can be difficult.  Frankly, the fang from big 
red and the new short sword seem overpowered when compared 
to the other weapons.  I am all for better weapons, but this means 
either everyone uses the fang or short sword, or several weapons 
need an upgrade.  Assuming upgrades are in order, here are my 
suggestions:
this is too long for one sensible note, so a series is in order

Hero level
In my opinion there should be weapons at hero level that are better 
than any other level weapons, except perhaps dragon claws.  
This will require several upgrades.  
[20420] The Golem Master's Weapon
    has all forges and good bonuses, but with an avg damage of 
    only 112, its not what i would call a real hero weapon.  an  
    avgerage of 135 is more suitable to the hero status.
[ 5946] Mila's Revenge
   a great whip, hard to obtain, never used, and no wonder
   avg 120 poison is NOT a hero level weapon.  wieght 50lbs is 
   also harmful for dualing.  I would like to see this as a new   
   choice for dualing.  wieght 40lbs avg 160 +30 hr/dr would suit it 
   nicely.
[11848] a tempered ->*<- throwing dagger
   this is your dagger dual at level 100? maybe this weapon
   was INTENDED to suck, cause it really does.  really its the avg 
   78 that kills it.  change this to around 140.
[19209] Demon's Claws
    I dont have all the stats on these, the dark demon is the 
    hardest mob outside of red forest.  His claws should be 
    awesome, the noremove is nice, but again, a low avg
    considering how hard these are to get, avg of 150 perhaps.
[21025] a shimmering psionic great-axe
    the world needs more and better axes.  again the only real 
    problem is the low avg.  avg 120 is now the standard for level 
    90.  try avg 155.

    i love this dagger, too bad the avg is too low.  is this a theme?
    make avg 138, to just beat out the ice dagger of malicar
[21031] the psionicist's staff
    increase avg to 135 to not quite beat the quest staff, but be 
    respectable on its own.  
[20418] A golem's heavy mace
    the best mace other than slayer.  i feel sorry for clerics.  this 
    mace NEEDS to be avg 155.
[ 5919] the Ivory Tusk
    two-handed? i would LOVE to see a two-handed weapon that 
    WORKS.  problem is the stats would have to be crazy.  why
     not, lets try.  most have 3rd + haste + dual = 5 attacks round.  
    no dual would be 4 attacks, so the weapon would have to make 
    up for one attack every 4, or be roughly 25% stronger than a 
    single handed weapon of same level.  avg 168 +60 hr/dr vamp 
    vorpal two-handed +200 hp.  
[  906] poseidon's Trident
    highest level polearm.  also two-handed.  suggest avg 165 and 
    double the hr/dr bonus.  
[19211] an undead axe
    raise avg to 130.

Subject weapons levels  60-89~

levels 60-89
My personal rule for weapons in this range
is a good weapon has avg damage = level
and one forge.  vamp is worth about 25% of
avg damage.  
the standard to judge weapons by are clear.
level 65 is scorpion death drop or eagle talons
sadly, these are the best primary daggers until level 85
the golem mage dagger then becomes the standard.
as for duals, the dragon katana at level 60 is not bested
until the chromatic dagger at level 79, which itself
holds until level 90.   I would like changes so that 
better weapons can be found every few levels, without
besting these weapons at their levels.  This should 
encourage use of different weapons without upsetting
the balance of the mud.  Also, i wouldlike changes 
so that levels 60-90 are not so focused on
daggers.  Here are my recommendations:
there are six swords at level 60 competing for your choice
as a dualed weapon.  oddly enough, there are no good primary
swords near this level.  
 
[10606] sword of Darkness 
    change weight to 10 lbs
[31431] the Castellan's Longsword 
    change weight to 40 lbs
[21022] a shimmering psionic scythe 
    change weight to 80 lbs
these weight changes will open a large number of combinations
for the six swords at level 60.

[11897] a silver Drakyri dagger
    high enough level, the weapon should have a forge
    suggest shock
[4505] a throwing knife 
    this should be a dagger, not exotic
[11634] a diamond longsword 
    make this competive with the level 64 daggers
    raise avg to 50 and add vamp
[21329] the Rapier of the Swordmaster 
    this sword should be good.  its too heavy
    who ever heard of a 350lb rapier?  still
    it doesnt make sense as a dual. change
    weight 50lb.  raise avg to 65.  
[23205] the Liquidator 
    make this a primary, weight 60 lbs
    it idens as avg 56, but actually is avg 63
    i guess i gotta start checkin that more
    needs forges, suggest flame vorpal
[23206] resurgence 
    this should be the next dual.  
    raise avg to 62 add frost
[11672] a sliver of darkness 
    ive targeted this to be the inbetween dagger
    raise avg to 70
[11875] a finely balanced adamantite longsword 
    next step in primary.  raise avg to 70
[19809] an axe of defoliation  
    raise avg to 75
[11726] an adamantite kris 
    raise avg to 72
[11867] A Hunter's Spear 
    add vamp
[21034] TaIJaN Guard's Mace 
    raise avg to 75
[19812] a willowent whip 
    raise avg to 80
[ 8406] The Fabuously Wealthy Baronet Von Bruinwald's Cane of Striking
    raise avg to 80
[11725] an adamantite shortsword
    raise avg to 80
[ 8418] Storm Bringer
    to be true to its origin, this needs vamp
    raise avg to 68, to be slightly better than
    the level 79 chromatic dagger.
[21077] a huge iron maul
    this is a two handed weapon.  the stats are for a single handed 
    weapon.  make it avg 100 and add vamp shock.  that might fix it.
[11854] a sapphire bladed -=+)> stiletto
    the next dual dagger.  raise avg to 80
[20405] A golem sword
    avg 65 seems a bit too low.  should be avg 80 
    the really high hr/dr makes it competitive at avg 80
[ 8404] Axe of Ulric
    someone made a dual capable axe.  what happened?
    suggest avg 83 sharp shock +5 hr/dr

Word of recall help file is incorrect, but the change should be made to
the spell, not the help file.  The spell CAN be cast on others.  Also, 
using this spell to escape a battle causes a greater exp loss than fleeing
I dont really think this should be.
 
 
Portal help file is incorrect.  By class only mages get the spell portal.

Text
Ender, I would really like to see all of our current clans have
at least 5 people in them before making more clans.....
but, since you have been such a model and loyal player I'll go ahead and
let you have your own clan. You deserve and have earned it.
  
1) The name and color of the clan will have to be preapproved
   by Venus (let me know if she already has).
  
2) The initial cost for the clan will be 50K gold.
   This will get you a main hall, 3 sets of free eq (not including your own)
   A healer and a donation pit.
  
3) The exit to your clan needs to be changed from Temple of Immortals
   to some place of your choosing and it will have a door but no locked.
  
4) You get 50 clan points to decorate your clan hall.
   Extra rooms = 10 clan points
   Deco objects = 5 clan points
   Deco mobiles = 5 clan points
  
5) Last of all.....
   I want you to send me a note with your main halls room name and description.
 
   Also in the note you should include:
   How many extra rooms you want, their names, description and
   which way they exit and to what room.
   Whether you want a guildmaster, potion seller or what.
   Your clan points will get you the mob but depending on which
   kind you want the prices are located in the RotRD info room.
   make sure to put the names of mobs, their short and long desc
   and the desc you see when you look at them.
 
   Also put what you want your eq to be named its short and long desc...
   all 3 types, backpack, flask and light.
 
I think that about covers the basics, any upgrades you want
we will do after you send me your note and I'm done building it.
Oh and dont forget to add color to the descriptions and names of stuff
also the healers name and the name of the donation pit...
 
Sorry the note was so long =)

Text
These are the top 4 code changes, hopefully Sembi will
be able to do them on Sunday, I hope, I hope =)
The first one is my idea which you approved, the rest
came from listening to the players on chat since Ive been back
 
1) Abbility to dual any weapon for all classes as long as primary weighs more
   - No restriction of has to be less than weight of 40
   - No restriction of has to be 1/2 weight either
   - Warriors ONLY can dual weapon same weight as primary
     cause they should be the strongest class on the mud
 
2) Take the cap off of attributes, right now spells that give
   bonuses to attributes are worthless once you have trained
   your stats to the max, also bonuses from eq is pointless
   because of this cap....remove it please =)
 
3) The lag time on assassinate should be lowered to match that
   of backstab, the difference then between thieves and
   assassins would be one gets bingo and one gets circle
 
4) Fix AC so that it actually matters, right now it does nothing
   but add numbers to your score....

Subject Legend~
Text
Once a player reaches 100% in each of the top scores, they can 'become'
a legend. To do this they must do must complete a grand quest,
different depending on if they pursue Nephilim or Eidolon.
Once they complete this quest they become either a 'Nephilim Legend'
or a 'Eidolon Legend'
They lose everything at this point. Skills, spells, items,
quest points, gold, everything.
They can buy ANY spell or skill with gold or quest points.
Every 5 levels of a legends life, they must complete a quest
in order to continue advancing.
These quests involve collecting X items and joining them together
to form a legend shard.
Over the course of their 100 levels they will create 20 of these shards.
These 20 shards then join togther into XYZ and does XYZ. 
Only legends may hold these items and shards. 
And they can't complete or gather items for a shard until they have
reached the correct level.
They also must kill an opposing legend every 10 levels or
else they cannot continue advancing.
Being mortal enemies each legend type is vulnerable to attack
from the other, regardless of choose status.
Legends cannot understand anything anyone says on any channel. 
In order to undertand and to be understood, they need to purchase 
the racial languages.
Each racial languages allows two-way communication with
that race on any channel.
 
This is what we have so far. it should start getting coded today

Hi Sembi,
Hide should make you not show up on scan
I understand that detect hidden lets you see the 
hidden mob/player in the room, but hide should 
still work if you are one or two rooms away...
Otherwise hide serves no purpose...
 
plus it just makes sense that perception can 
reveal someone in the room, but far away one
would likely be unable to see them...

Subject Mob and Eq guidlines~
Text
I understand the guildlines are not finished yet, but
i have concerns based upon what they currently are.
My concerns are that the mob guildlines would create mobs
significantly tougher than the existant mobs, while the
equipment guildlines would substantially lower the capabilities
of the players.  I personally think this would create a great
challenge in leveling a character, but as we have seen with
the advent of hours, MOST players do not want such a challenge.
I do honestly fear for the playerbase if these changes are made.
also, i have concern for newbies if these mob guildlines are
enforced, as a level 1 character without a spellup will have
to flee from a mob with 40 hps 5 hr 3 dr (the guildlines for
a level 1 mob).  I agree that changes at the hero level are
needed, and that the entire mud needs standards to balance it.

Hi Sembi
   Gauntlet master is on the list of mobs for top,
is it possible to kill him?  Also, none-mage/clerics
can't explore that area since its' only accessible
by teleport
   I'm note sure, but clan halls is another that are
only accessible by those with gate or those in that
clan...
   I once ended up in an area called old world but
have never ended up back there... is it walkable?
I think it's related to the clan areas, but don't 
know for sure...
neph stronghold is not generally accessible yet, but
one can get a mage to summon you there easily enough.
   There is an area that always ends up on people's
list - it's 2 rooms with an oaken table...
   it's one mob, 2 rooms, the mob's name starts with D.
THere are a number of somewhat disconnected areas 
like that.  Also, part of red forest is disconnected.
It's up from phoenix, but cannot be entered there.
If one teleports in there, the only exit is down
to where phoenix is. (one way).

I'll look for disconnected rooms, but I'm not sure how to

Also, do places like teleparia belong on top lists?
my understanding is that it's really an imm area.

Hi Venus,
   Rivals had an internet radio interview with Dr. Tom.
It went well, he explained why he'd gone to the option
(OK killed us with mobile quarterbacks), plus it was
easier to recruit since everyone else wants the 
pro-style QB.  He said Tommy F. was only recruited
assassinate a running back at other schools.  But he then said
(when asked about Bill C. going to WCO) that he hopes
Bill Callahan has success, so it didn't come across 
assassinate negative.
He said that Turner Gill was probably his most complete
QB (although he had an NFL receiver on the team which 
helps - my comment) for running and passing the ball.
He listed Tommy F. as being right up there along with
Scoff Frost, etc...
Take care,

Hi,
   I started dying and realize I can't hold out for

quest points on second and third attacks.  Unfortunately, when
I attack with versbose on, I see no evidence that I'm getting
them (I see main attack and haste attack, but not other two).
Is dual wield a prerequisite to the other two?
That brings up a good question - would it let me buy
fourth attack before I buy second and third?  If some are
prequisites for others, how do we know (checked help, dual
gives info so I know what level it is, second gives help
file, so I can't tell if it's higher or lower than dual).
This is maybe not a problem with the old timers...

it, but it wasn't there when I created. I was also unable to
train it beyond 1%.  Argon set it to 75% and with verbose
mode (casting chill touch) it does SAY it's adding to damage.
(I'd hate to see chill touch without it!).
4) I do not have kick, but if I type kick while fighting
(habit - an alt has kick) it works, and does as much damage
assassinate trip which I did gain (for some kind of extra attack)
- for grins I tried whirl and that appears to work (badly), but
it's probably only bad due to the fact that I haven't learned
sword :).
Thus, skills while usuable, are also somewhat broken - it just
occurred to me that I should have tried dual wielding - prob.
will work...
broken in the sense that it seems to let me use them without
gaining them...
5)
quest points transfers - can be done via stones - I trashed 17.5 qp
when I recreated, which isn't a lot, Most will transfer them
to alts, and then transfer them back to legend after remort.
Thus, the qp costs will be immaterial unless stones doesn't 
allow a legend to accept a game where the other person 
wagers qp...
6) 
my stats are limited for some reason - don't know if another
person creating would have that problem or if it's in my
code from how things were when I remorted.
7)
I'm willing to test whatever else you need, including
remorting if that will help clean up or clear up any 
problems...
on 6, an imm looking at me sees 40/40/40/40/40 so it must
be showing the chars of eidolon, but it thinks I'm a
sidhe elf mage, so that is why I'm limited.
 
The first thing a legend should do is spend trains bumping up WIS
to whatever level gives one maximum practices per level.  Trains
are goign to be limiting, so all the extra practices can be
converted to trains to train up the rest of the stats and buy
skills.  Con should be next to get max HP per round, and INT
would be last IF we have anything that can start at 1% (fewer
pracs to learn stuff).  I'm not sure if INT really helps on
skills...
 
All I can think of at the moment - I thought it might help
to summarize what I've found so far...  A lot may be tied
to thinking I'm a sidhe elf mage - apparently eidolons are 
supposed to be able to go to any guild, but I can't, I can
go to the mage's guild only, etc... the limited stats,
perfectly consistent with sidhe elf, etc...
 
Thanks,

continuing from my previous message...
I tried dualing a dagger and it works like a charm,
BUT... with verbose combat stats I see no attack with
the dual weapon, and again no attack from second and
third attack...
 
It's pretty cool - I want to make that clear - I 
am the guinea pig, so I want to help get it 
ready for when the next person starts.  It taks a 
lot of thought and strategy to figure out how to
be most efficient with QP, trains, etc and I really
enjoy that...  Please don't take my bug reports
assassinate complaints - I was told that there were issues
and part of what was needed to me was to report them.
I have changed strategies by necessity from what I 
would have done if all was working, but there is a
lot of fun there in figuring out how to make the best of 
it :)

Text
For low levels normal mort questing wasn't a big deal,
but now the questmaster giving level 22 quests to the
caves of cloudy mountain and drakyri isle etc. is 
gonna make it tough for legends.  If normal quests
are going to be a part of the qp generation for 
legends, then some work on his selection of quests
would help a lot.  If legends will exclusively use
another mechanism, then it's not such a big deal.
Also, in my 20s I get between 25 and 33 qp/quest,
is there any chance that legend can get a bonus on qp
amounts - i.e. a level 5 legend is not really the 
same as a level 5 normal mort?
I still get no bonus in qp for being on all of 
the top lists which now I really miss :)
I think that's it for this set of observations.

quest cards
this was suggested to me by a new player.  
the idea is to have cards (sorta like certs)
that have a list of items the questor is
to collect and turn in to obtain the quest
points.  then there could be like 30 such 
cards and you can only get a new one when
you have completed the old one.  the qps
per card would be based upon the difficulty
of obtaining the items.  This could also make
certain rarely used items (like dragon claws)
more valuable.
qps based on quest difficulty, told when quest requested
the quests given are supposed to be taylored to your level,
but i swear that the questmaster forgets this from time to
time. He often sends younger questors upon insane quests of
certain death.  IF the qp amount was based upon the difficulty
of the quest vs player level, and the player was told upon 
requesting the quest, this could help with my feelings of
guilt when i tell lower level players to quest, knowing
there is a chance that they will be horribly killed doing so.
 
 
 
quest items that grow and learn by being used
i played this other mud once, and they claimed that their
quest items gained exp and levels and basically 'grew' with
the player, so that you would continue to use the item even
though you have far surpassed its original purpose.  this just 
sounded really cool, and it would certainly increase the number
of players that buy quest items.

hah, the quest card idea is drawn from godwars type

what kind of coding it would take to impliment it.
 
(i have a certain loathing for questcards... in my
mudding days ive probably completed several thousand
of them -_-)
 
as for items that 'grow' with a person... you have
to decide how you want the item to enhance the player
within the constraints of the variables we have to
manipulate.  will the hr dr go up as use goes up?
or will it allow percent of the weapon type to go
past 100%?  will the weapon average slowly raise?
then what determines how the weapon grows... time
the player has held the item? used the item? quested
on the item?

assassinate though I gained and trained it.  I can whirl (without gaining it)
but it acts like it's 1% (always fails). so Skills gain themselves

Hi Argon,
   in room 3814 there is an evil blue dragon which leaves no corpse
This one has a key which cannot be gotten otherwise (except for
possibly heat metal or charm would do it).
A couple of the other dragons in this area also leave no corpse.
Thanks,

Subject bad rooms in midgaard, maybe elsewhere~
Text
I found that two guilds are still counted toward top list:
Cleric's guild (inner sanctum) counts (3002)
The Guild of Swordsmen (3023) counts
3059 one-way exits down to tc healer (3054) - not accessible other than teleport
all of the guild healers are counted: 
  room vnums (3371-3376, 3038,  + 3216)
3080 not connected to the rest of midgaard, 
but is connected to 10001, which is not connected to Crystalmir lake
so both of those rooms need to be removed from top, or reconnected
there is a key (3121) that I can't find (forgot the imm command)
  Thus, I'm not sure if it's accessible or not...
Thanks

Text
if your shopkeepers are not where they are supposed to be
first check the resets in the rooms they are supposed to be in
if the resets are there, then make sure you flagged the
shopkeepers themselves for sentinel, which means stay in the room
they reset in, also use the stay flag on ALL mobs, this means if
they arent sentinel, then they wander around the area, but as long
as they are flagged STAY, then they wont actually leave the
area, which can happen....make sure those mobs have the sentinel flag
which by the way if they have sentinel they dont need the stasy flag,
and if they do and you think the resets are right and they still wont
stay, then write me antoher note and ill check it out for you....

formula should be min+max/2 or N*(M+1)/2.
