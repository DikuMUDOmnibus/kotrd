sometimes i log on and multi torm torm torm a mob
just to remind myself why i spent hour sand hours
accumulating the gear that i have.
 
any doubts about my superiority in real life are
forgotten as i rock the dragon gear with my
stylish deathkiss backpack.
 
thank you, thank you.  old fantasies die hard.

is there any way someone can fix the map book so all
map books are available?  thus far only 1-5 are readable
and doing quests is really hard when the area is alien to some of us.
any help would be greatly appreciated.  thanks so much!!

Subject April 1 - 7PM Eastern - 11:11PM Switch Throw!~
Text
Okay everyone, on April first, I will be logging in at 7PM Eastern.
Feel free to log on earlier if you'd like.
We can have good conversations, maybe a game of acro or two.
At 11:11PM April 1 2007 the mud will be shut down.
Will it ever return? Perhaps not.
 
So scrounge up every old e-mail you can find of old players.
Notify anyone you can think of, and come celebrate the good times
we've all had here over the past 10 years or so.
 
I look forward to seeing everyone then!
 
Sembi
