Subject Status of the MUD~
Text
So... this mud is pretty dead now a days.
There are maybe 2 or 3 people who log on from time to time to play.
Both sides have been throwing back and forth
allegations of using builder commands to have an advantage
over a regular player.
 
I don't really know how to handle any of this really.
I keep the mud running just because it doesn't cost me anything.
The server it runs on is my server and even without the mud
I'd still be running it.
 
I never knew how to handle player disputes in the past,
and I still don't now. I've never been a typical 'imm' as I've
always focused on the coding aspects and left the politics
to others.
 
I really don't know what to do about the disputes.
 
Maybe it's time to just close the mud down for good?
Never to run again? Never to host a player again?
 
I'd like to hear anyones opinion that still logs in.
Feel free to post a message to everyone in reply to this, letting
me know how you feel.

All,
I would rather remember this mud in its glory and not it's fall.
I've seen numerous muds come to this end, but I wish not to of this one.
 
Sembi, I do believe you're right to end the mud as it stands.
It's definitely a used and abused mud, from the years.
We've all gotten our experience from different aspects.
though, I doubt anyone would read this! 
Most are now gone and moved on, names go on.
I've had a fun time, but the fun must end =)
Have fun guys, and have a happy life.
Ciao
Crovax

I would have to agree. The pbase is 0. It has had its moments of 
Glory.
I think the rebirth of the red dragon was fun when it first came up
The pwipe started the downfall, and then the lack of immship
You did an awesome thing to host it on your server to keep it
Alive.
I would have to say it probably would be a good thing to let it die.
Never to host a new person, never to be visited, never to breathe.
I have much pride in this mud and utterly hate its abuse. 
No Rules. 
If we were serious someone would pay for hosting at other sites, but
I hate to admit to it, there are probably other places which are
more populated and more fun to play (because of people playing). 
unless we have other serious people to give it a try meaning advertising etc.
I'd say make the suffering end :) 
 
Peace out, I'll check in from time to time to see if anyone else posts or what 
your decision is.

Somehow I feel partially at fault.  I have not been around as much lately.
I still feel loyal to this mud, I want to play here and not somewhere else,
but I agree that the mud should not continue in this state.  If the mud goes
down, I expect that I shall not play anywhere until such time as it is brought
back.  To that end, my only real concern is; how can I ensure that the mud 
can be brought back at some when I, and perhaps others, will have more time
to play it?  At some point in the future I might even have the money to pay
for professional advertising and/or hosting.  I am as serious about this mud
as I ever was, but playing alone gets old quick and finding the time to play
is difficult right now. 
I guess I am still fantasizing about this mud being successful, and I am
not really ready to give up.  As long as I know how to bring the mud back
if I win the lottery or something, then I can continue to fantasize.  Thats
all I ask; that you allow me to continue my dream...

Well, that's a pretty unified view.
So... this is the official announcement.
 
The mud will shut down on the night of April 1, 2007.
 
No, it's not an April's fools joke :)
 
I don't have an hour in mind yet.
Everyone post up what times your available (in US time please
Eastern, Pacific, etc)
It would be nice to get as many as we can on near the end
and have some talks, maybe a game of acro ;)
 
I'll be checking the mud more often over the next few weeks,
until next time.
 
Talk to you later.

Thats a sunday?  Just tell me what time an Ill be here.  I am still
concerned for how I would go about bringing the mud back in like say
ten years?  I think a one or two year surge every ten years is about
right for a mud.

Hi folks, this is Schalla >_<
I just wanted to stop in and say thanks
to Sembi for letting me know this was shutting down
Its been a long time since I talked to anyone
from this MUD, so I'll try to stop in on the 1st
 
If anyone is interested, I play a brand new
MMO, Vanguard, its a lotta fun and great graphics.
And I'm sure I could find anyone a guild there.
 
Hope all are well.  Take care and hope I see you soon!

Greetings all.
It will be sad to see this place go, but in reading everyone else's
thoughts, it does make sense to let this place fall in it's glory
then to let it sink into oblivion.  This MUD has been through a lot, and
as people come and go, there really is no hope for a 'revival' anytime
soon.  I'd like to leave this place with my current and glorious memories
- not the fact that Knights of the Red Dragon has become stagnant.
{x
Cheers all.  I will be on April 1st.

Respectfully,
Rinaldus/Spyro/Mantis
