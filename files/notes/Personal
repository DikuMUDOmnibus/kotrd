Subject weapons~

I am working on balancing the equipment, starting with
weapons.  I am not going to change any of the more popular
equipment, but I do not like to see so much junk eq, 
so I am upgrading ALOT of the other equipment.  The basic
scheme I have figured for weapons is average damage equal
to level, and +HR +DR roughly 10% of level.  This will not
really make any weapon more powerful than the well known
ones, but will give more options.  I also intend to reduce
the stupid damage types and change some weapons from exotic.
Lastly, if I notice a large level gap without a certain
weapon type, I will create one.

Subject weapon gap~
Text
Hey, stumpy
If i recall correctly, there is a large gap
in Maces from levels 30-80
The only one that doesn't suck is the hero's mace
from the questmaster
Other than that, they are pretty terrible.
If you are still balancing weapons, lemme know, I can help with the maces
I have leveld many a cleric through to hero

Subject I love this mud to:~

Hey guys,
I'm writing this because I love this mud too much to let this
Keep happening as I'm seeing it. 
It sikkens me to see this luther character spawn level 500
"Robots" and plvl multitudes of characters and make 
utterly imbalanced weaponry.
I can't let this happen, and will try everything I can to 
Keep this corruption of a beautiful mud to a minimum. 
Since i'm not an implementor or a high ranking imm
The only thing I can do now is write down and post the findings
I see that luther is doing.
Right now, he is making WMD's for his friend or brother to use
As well as himself, doing stupid damage. 
When I confront him of this issue he simply says 
"I don't have to stay here." 
If this is the kind of player we want in here, I want no part of it.
I hope you guys log in from time to time to check notes. I'll refuse
To play in a place where rule is nothing and there is no honesty in
the players that play :) 
 
Sorry, just very upsetting to see this happening. 
I remember a time when Ramsus was an imm or one of his bros
They made a char and they leveled off of it, he was banned.
I guess times have changed right? 
 
-Jon

So I removed Luther from the game.
I also attempted to find other characters he played and removed those too
Characters Removed: Luther  Kildare   Macphisto
I'm going through to try and find any items that he made that are crazy
and will see about deleting them

Subject Crovax~
Text
I am assuming I was deleted for using powerful eq made by my builder.
While I don't agree with that since this is a dead MUD (no playerbase or imms,
and I was one of 2 people playing consistently) and as such I don't see
how there are a lot of "rules," fine. But if Serpterion and Crovax
want to complain, it should be known that Crovax himself has builder commands
as a "mortal." He described himself as a "broken mort." Yet he goes around
using goto and load and whatever else to help himself out.
In fact, I think Serpterion and him loaded a strong weapon my builder made
in order to crash the mud as a way of getting me "found out." So it was them who
brought the MUD down, I was not using the weapon at the time (if
that is in fact what crashed it). Anyway, I just think that
if the rules are going to be enforced on me like that,
then Crovax should be deleted for basically doing the same thing with
his character.
That's all, thanks.

Your character file is stored for safekeeping and can be restored
I just haven't decided what to do about the mud
This is pretty much a 'dead mud'
I'll be making another public post about the state of the mud

Hey, I appreciate you getting back to me/anyone who may log on.
Don't worry about the whole dispute thing, I mainly just
wanted to make sure Crovax's activity was known in addition to mine.
It's cool to have this MUD up that some of us spent so much time
playing in the past. Even if its dead now, it is fun to be able to log on
and play around. So I vote for keeping it up.
