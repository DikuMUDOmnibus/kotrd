You have reached the base of Firetop Mountain. The steep impenetrable face
that rises before you is deeply gouged, as if by the claws of a gargantuan
beast. Strange red vegetation grows at the peak, hence the mountain's name.

Firetop Mountain, domain of the evil Warlock.

You see a small sign stuck to a nearby withered tree.

Yaegar for AnonyMud, though any Merc 2.2 Mud can (and is indeed welcome to)
use it".

{MThe Chieftain's Quarters{x~
You have entered the quarters of the leader of the Orcs of Firetop Mountain.
He is standing here brandishing a big bullwhip, which he is using to beat
another, smaller Orc, presumably his batman or servant. A chest in the far
corner catches you eye, and you wonder what wealth this Chieftain may
possess...

{MThe Orc Kitchen{x~
It is here that the Orcs prepare their meals and partake of them, seated at
long filthy benches deeply scarred and stained. Pots and pans bubble and fry
atop a wood-burning cast-iron stove, and from it an Orc occasionally serves
himself some rat stew and grits. The Orcs in here seem far too engrossed in
their gastronomic acitivities to notice your presence, though doubtless they
would react strongly were you to disturb their meals.

This room houses the shipbuilder and his faithful dog. There are bits of
wood and tools lying about everywhere, and a section of hull serves as a
resting bench for the shipbuilder, who can usually be found sprawled over
it. There is a door to the west, as well as the southern one you originally

{MA Construction Site{x~
You have come across a construction site, where an effort is being made to
construct a tunnel downwards from this passage. This in itself isn't unusual-
what makes this so weird is the fact that the laborers are animated tools,
industrious picks, shovels and spades, working and singing merrily as they
do! Some of them even stop to make smalltalk with you. You may rest here as
long as you want, as the toosl will prevent you from any harm. However, you
cannot attack them, as they are quite immune to your puny efforts.

the Warlock is something of a nautical man. This room is usually filled
with skeletons busily constructing boats for the Warlock, and occasionally
the chief ship-builder will actually be doing his job here.

There are doors to the north and west.
