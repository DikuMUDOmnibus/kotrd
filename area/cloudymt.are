This area is based on the Intellivison game "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons" 
which is of course based on TSR's role playing game.  The name Cloudy Mountain,
the caves in Cloudy Mountain and the mobs in Cloudy Mountain are taken 
directly from the game and credit should be given to Matel Electronics and TSR.
The city/village is from Scourge, summer 1996.  Some mob ideas are from TSR's

In this are many dragons and half-dragons.  Under normal circumstances,
dragons tend to live in solitary environments, but due to disappearing 
territories, many have gathered in this city.  Some have also have taken 
spouses from other races, creating new half-races.  Although legally these
half-dragons are to be treated equal, most of the high ranking officials and
officers are pure dragon.

You seem to have entered Cloudy Mountain itself.  The caves appear dark from
a distant but seem to light up when you enter them.  The cavern is damp and
you hear dragons snoring deep within.  Legend has it that the Crown of Kings
are guarded by two winged dragons.  High levels may adventure forth, whereas
low and middle levels should turn back.
