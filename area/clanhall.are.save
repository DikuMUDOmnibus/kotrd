cup~
This cup is the most saught after treasure in the entire mud.  All clans
struggle through tedious quests attempting to call this cup their own.  Any
clan leader would sell his soul for this cup, but few have ever placed it in
their hall.  Its present raises morale of the entire clan, and some say it
embodies the very spirit of the Red Dragon, rejuvinating any who gaze upon
it.  As new and old clans alike step up and prove themselves as the best
clan in the mud the cup changes hands, and every time it does the new owners
name is engraved in to the precious metal below:

{MUnderground tunnel{x~
The underground tunnel is very wide.  It has wooden braces supporting the
ceiling on both sides of the tunnel.  Torches that burned out long ago still
hang on the walls.  Upon closer examination of the walls, it is clear that
this tunnel was dug very quickly, perhaps as an escape route.  One can only
guess what sort of thing could cause such a panic.  The only obvious exits
are up and down.

The tunnel continues further down.  Into the earth.  In the far left
corner of the tunnel rests a pile of bones.  Perhaps beloning to someone
trying to escape, but trampelled in the haste of those trying to flee.  The
temperature has risen to almost an uncomfortable level.  Odd, for an
underground tunnel.  The only obvious exits are up and down.

The heat in the tunnel continues to rise.  It is unclear where the heat
is coming from, perhaps this tunnel reaches to the core of the earth.  The
unexplained heat has caused the dirt to smolder in various places.  The only

This appears to be the remains of a city entrance.  How the city, or the
ruins of it, came to be underground is a mystery.  The city is still in
fairly good condition, with only time doing its usual damage.  It is as if
the city was abandoned in a matter of days.  Anyone that foolishly stayed
behind is long gone by now.  The intense, unexplained heat would drive
anyone mad after a short period of time.

{MWall road{x~
This road runs past what is left of a large city wall.  The road is some
sort of paved stone, while the ceiling is made up of dirt from the earth. 
Parts of the wall reach the ceiling, while the rest is only 4ft in height. 
To the north is what appears to be training grounds, while the south leads
to an apparent graveyard.

{MWall Road{x~
The wall continues along the road.  As the wall moves closer to the city,
it is clear that parts of it are buried under tons of dirt and earth.  This
dirt and earth blocks passage to many directions, areas that once were
market places, schools and temples.  The only passable exits are north and
south.

This is what remains of class training grounds.  Objects strewn about
make it seem as if it is a fighting training ground, but it is unclear.  The
walls are completly coverd in black, burned to the crisp.  The intense heat
of this room is comparable to that of the ones before, unbearable.  The only
obvious, passable exit is south.

The EQ Types a Clan may purchase are listed below.  The QuestPoint cost to purchase
a given type can be totaled by Multiple Clan Members (meaning ALL Clan Members can
contribute to the cost).  This also applies to the GOLD Piece cost required to buy a
single piece of the EQ.
 
{cBACKPACK {w- {CQP{w: {W1500  {CGP{w: {W20,000  {CLEVEL{w: {W25{X
{cLIGHT SOURCE {w- {CQP{w: {W1000 {CGP{w: {W15,000 {CLEVEL{w: {W20{X
{cDRINK CONTAINER {w- {CQP{w: {W700 {CGP{w: {W10,000 {CLEVEL{w: {W20{X
 
{xThe {CQP{D({WQuestPoint{D) {xCost is ONLY paid ONCE.  After the Initial purchase,
your Clan will own that EQ Type, after which you can buy a number of pieces of that
type equal to the number of Members your clan has, or as you recruit new Members.
If you lose one you can NOT buy another one, the MAX allowed is Equal to your Member
count.
 
After the EQ Type is purchased, you may not later change it to another Type.  Each
Clan can have upto 3 different Types MAX, so choose wisely.
 
The Clan Leader is responsible for coming up with the DESC of the item and letting
Argon or Venus know, once theEQ DESC is set, it may not be changed.  
 
Following are the Guidelines for nameing your Items:
1) Your Clan Name MUST be in the SHORT DESC (Caroman or Dreamslayer can explain what the
   Short Desc is).
2) The EQ Type must be discernable from looking at the DESC.
(i.e. A legal name for a CLAN BACKPACK would be something like:
      {WA {bDRIDER {WClan BackPack{x   ...  Where as a Clan BlackPanther named:
      {WA Glowing Silver Plate{x   ...  Would not be. )

CLAN WARS A clan war is in fact a war, hehe, between two clans.  Now on
this mud players run around killing eachother all the time, so in fact
everyone is in a state of constant "war".  But for everyones fun, not to
mention A clan war is in fact a war, hehe, between two clans.  Now on this
mud players run around killing eachother all the time, so in fact everyone
is in a state of constant "war".  But for everyones fun, not to mention 
 
1)Clan who wishes to declare a war writes a formal note to all saying who they are declaring a war against, and why.  This not should also include what they are demanding from the clan that they are attacking.  Here 
is an example of this, I run clan A, i want to attack clan B, i write a note saying i want to attack clan B because they killed and looted so many of my clan members.  Then i would write that I demand 100k gold, 
and 5 of their clans backpacks for compensation.
 
2)The other clan leader then gets 2 days to respond saying that he accepts the war, or that he is willing to just pay the 100k gold and 5 clan backpacks.  If they do not respond then the war is on!
3)To win the clan war your clan must be the first to kill TEN clan members from the opposing clan.  From the time that clan B responds or two days following clan As note there is two weeks, 14 days to accomplish 
 
4)If clan A wins, then clan B has another 2 weeks to come up with the payment.  If, on the other hand., clan A losses, then they must pay DOUBLE what they requested to clan B.  In this example they would have to 
pay 200k g and 10 of their clans backpacks. 
5)After the loosing clan gathers the correct payment, they must first give the complete payment to Caroman, and he will then give it to the winning clan, to make sure everything is fair.
6)If the loosing clan fails to come up with the money their clan hall is reduced to the minumum size, and their clan gets one STRIKE, if a clan gets two strikes in a six week perid, their clan is disbanded.
7)After completion of a clan war, the winning clan may not declair another war on the loosing clan for three weeks.

cnote~
Ok, here are some ideas and such we would like to have put to paper so everyone
can follow them.  These are just suggestions (unless otherwise noted) and you can
use or ignore whichever of them you want.
 
CLAN EQ - If you want to create new EQ for the clans, that is great with 2 restrictions:
        1) All of the items must be the same for each clan.
        2) You need to let one of the Imps see the item(s) before you allow the
           Clan Imms to start passing them out.  This is not cause we don't trust
           you, it is so that we (mostly me) can make sure the code won't freak
           or become unbalanced because of it.
        3) No more than 2 new pieces please (we don't want players to think
           we favor clans.  And only 1 of them can/should be a weapon.
 
CLAN HALLS - Upto you as to what the clans have to do to be able to buy new rooms for
           for their Halls, wether it be gold or QP is upto you.  (If you want the 
           QP certs again for the Questmaster let me know).  Only thing is you (or
           an immortal you get to help you) has to build the rooms, no color pukeing
           on the screen (i.e. VALOR  ;)  )   Let the rooms look p
           professional so the MUD will.
 
QUITTING CLANS - Again this is upto but it should be difficult.  Only guide is, once a 
           player quits a clan, they can not join another one (but they stay pkill) 
           unless they give you a real good reason.  (This is just a guide, but if
           you follow it you will save yourself alot of heartache, we allowed players
           to change clans without restriction and eery other day players were clan
           flipping so they could cheat (or to join another clan so they could die alot
           and ruin their pk-record) so the best thing is to make rules for quitting
           but don't let them rejoin unless you want to deal with that ;) ....
 
JOINING CLANS - If you want rules for joining clans that apply to all clans, make them
           but also remember the individual clan Imms have rules also, maybe get with
           them all and see if ya'll can make rules for all clans together.
 
MORTALS MAKING CLANS - We are willing to try this for the first time BUT if you decide
           to allow the morts to make and run their own clans you need to write some 
           very detailed rules about what it takes to make one, the cost, the guidelines
           and more...  These need to be LOOPHOLE proof or the players will get stupid,
           also it should cost a BUNDLE of gold or QP (maybe allow a group to all chip i
           to form their clan) for 2 reasons, ONLY 9 more clans can be added and each
           clan is restricted to 13 members (13 members so we can spread out the PCs).
           So if you want to watch over this, make the rules tough or cheesey clans
           will get made ;)  
 
DISBANDING CLANS - Make this UGLY if you allow morts to make clans.
         Make it hurt for wasting your time and the other players making a clan they
         didn't stick with, and if the clan just melts away to nothing all on its
         own without them disbanding, you might want to penalize the PC that started
         the clan ;)  again, upto you if you want to or not and/or even how...
 
Well these are the things Lybre Pyros and I have talked about and some are things 
players have sent in.  The above is a guide though, you are the Immortal in Charge
of Clan Rules and Regulatoins so do whatever you think should be/needs to be done
to get life back into the Clans ;) ...

Every Clan may have upto 3 pieces of Standard Clan EQ.  The Clan must purchase the EQ
Type from Argon using QuestPoints, once an EQ Type is purchased it can not
be changed.
 
After the EQ Type is purchased, the Clan must buy the actual EQ using Gold for each
Item they wish to get.  Only 1 of Each Piece my be bought per Clan Member upto the 
Number of EQ Types your Clan owns.
 
i.e. To purchase the BACKPACK EQ Type, the Clan must spend 1500 QuestPoints.  After that
     each Clan BACKPACK the Clan wishes to buy for its Members will cost 20,000 gold per
     BACKPACK, and the Clan may only buy a number of BACKPACKs equal to thier Number of 
     Members (as new members get recruited, a new set of EQ may be bought for them).

{CMORTAL CLANS{x
 
A mortal clan is a clan that is run by a mortal, as opposed to an immortal. The
rules for how clan halls and stuff like that are exactly the same for mortal and
immortal clan leaders. However, how a mortal obtains his or her clan is a little
bit different. When you see a note from {WAr{bg{Don{x that says there is a opening for
a new mortal clan you should first write a note to {WAr{bg{Don{x that explains the
following things about the clan you wish to make.
 
{R1){x A detailed {MRP{x explination of your clan, what your clans mission 
is, why it is, how it came to be, exc. anything else on the {MRP{x side that you
put in will help your clan to be chosen.
 
{R2){x A very detailed description of how your clan will be run, if you are the
sole leader, or if their is more than one leader. Say how new members can be 
admitted to your clan and how they would be kicked out. Is your clan aggressive
or passive? {YNote: No race/class/gender specific clans allowed.{x
 
{R3){x A small blurb about why you in particular should be awarded the honor of
running a clan.
 
{R4){x This note should not be a book, but it should be fairly long, as the more
{WAr{bg{Don{x knows about your clan the more likely he is to pick it.
 
{R5){xInclude how long you have played the mud, and your chars level/class/race.
Here are a few criteria a person must meet before even being considered for a 
clan:
 
 
             {r1){xYou must have been in a clan or pk up until you apply.
 
             {r2){xIf you have one, your current clan leader must approve your leaving.
               Any punishment or penalty for abandoning your clan that your clan leader
               sees fit shall be carried out before you can start your own clan.
 
             {r3){xIf you are running a clan you may not abandon it without haveing a
               lieutenant to take over your clan. This may not be done without warning.
 
             {r4){xYou must be a remort with a minimum level of 50.
 
             {r5){xEvery application costs the person {Y20k gold{x, if you dont have the 
               money, dont send an application or {WAr{bg{Don{x shall give you a very great
               penalty for wasting his time {W:){x
 
             {r6){xAn additional {Y50k gold{x is due at the time {WAr{bg{Don{x says. 
               If you do not have it, then the next best clan will be choosen. 
 
After you have choosen a clan and it has been acepted, you will be given 2 weeks
to gather 3 members. You may have your alts join your clan but they will not
count towards the 3 members. Your clan may not drop below 3 members or it will
be disbanded. Each clan may have a maximum of 10 members, after which you must deny
all applicants or decide if they are worth haveing more than others. You may not
kick out players from your clan without reason. If you want someone removed
from your clan, send a note to {WAr{bg{Don{x and state who the person is and the reason you want
them removed.
 
 
While in your clan you must be a model player. This means you will follow all mud rules
and rarely break them. If you break a major rule, your clan will either be given to
your liuetenant or disbanded. Your clan must be active, although not as much as you.

{CCLAN WARS{x
 
A clan war is in fact a war, hehe, between two clans.  Now on
this mud players run around killing eachother all the time, so in fact
everyone is in a state of constant "war".  But for everyones fun, there will 
be an actual declaration of war. Here are the rules as follows:
 
{R1){x Clan who wishes to declare a war writes a formal note to all saying who they are declaring a war against, and why. This note should also include what they are demanding from the clan that they are attacking. Here is an example of this:
 
I run clan {MA{x, I want to attack clan {GB{x, I write a note saying I want to attack clan {GB{x because they killed and looted so many of my clan members.  Then I would write that I demand {Y100k gold{x, 
and 5 of their clans backpacks for compensation.
 
{R2){x The other clan leader then gets {W2 days{x to respond saying that he\she accepts the war, or that he\she is willing to just pay the {Y100k gold{x and 5 clan backpacks.  If they do not respond then the war is on!
 
{R3){x To win the clan war your clan must be the first to kill {DTEN{x clan members from the opposing clan.  From the time that clan {GB{x responds or two days following clan {WA{x's note there is two weeks,{W({x14 days{W){x to accomplish this.
 
{R4){x If clan {WA{x wins, then clan {GB{x has another {W2 weeks{x to come up with the payment. If, on the other hand, clan {WA{x losses, then they must pay {MDOUBLE{x what they requested to clan {GB{x.  In this example they
would have to pay {Y200k gold{x and 10 of their clans backpacks. 
 
{R5){x After the losing clan gathers the correct payment, they must first give the complete payment to {WAr{bg{Don{x, and he will then give it to the winning clan, to make sure everything is fair.
 
{R6){x If the losing clan fails to come up with the money their clan hall is reduced to the minumum size, and their clan gets one {rSTRIKE{x, if a clan gets two strikes in a six week perid, their clan is disbanded.
 
{R7){x After completion of a clan war, the winning clan may not declare another war on the losing clan for {Wthree weeks{x.
