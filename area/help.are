Brief and compact help set your display
options for the game. Typing brief 
toggles on and off the showing of room

helpful if you are being bombarded by
messages from other players.  You can
still use reply to reply to people who 
were telling you before you went deaf,
although you cannot reply to a deaf
person unless you or they are a diety
(it's mostly useful for sending a quick
"I'm being spammed so I went deaf" 
message to a person).

0 PET PETS~
{b
***************************************
{r

0 TICK~
{b
***************************************
{r
Many of the game actions are based upon
interval timers,including combat, most
autonomous monster actions,hp/mana/move
regeneration, spell duration, weather, 
and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move
regeneration timer is popularly called
the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average
30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds
to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every
3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.
Also note that objects lying on the
ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.

0 CAST~
{b            ******************************************
{r
                 Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
{r
       Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.
           The more you practice, the higher chance you 
      have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
           The mana cost decreases as your level increases.
{r
              The <target> is optional.  Many spells 
                  which need targets will use an
        appropriate default target, especially during combat.
{r
           If the spell name is more than one word, then 
                 you must quote ( ' )the spell name.
{C                  
                 Example: cast 'cure critic' frag. 
{r 
            Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
                 You can abbreviate the spell name.
{r
        When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually
            gets a saving throw. The effect of the spell 
          is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
                     saving throw successfully.

101 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

101 DENY~

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.

Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of

command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

{GIMPLEMENTOR{x

  {cImplementors, called Imp(s) for short, are the ones that decide on, or put
  {cin motion, the rules that govern the MUD.  They are also the last word on
  {cANY issue, dispute, misunderstanding, etc.. having to do with the MUD, the
  {cPlayers, the Immortals, the Code, the Rules, the Interpretation of the Rules
  {cor anything else that might need a 'final' judgement made for it.{x 
 
  {cOnly an Imp can promote another player to the status of Immortal or demote 
  {can Immortal back to the status of mortal.

  Finally, and the biggest thing, the Implementors are the ones that {COWN{c the
  MUD.  When you play here, try and think of it as being a guest in our house.  
  Don't disrespect, curse at, etc.. us and we will show you the same courtesy, 
  plus we will be more than happy to keep inviting you back to hang out with us, 
  but if you do break the dishes and insult us, don't be surprised to find yourself
  out on the street and the door locked behind you....{x


{GASSISTANT IMPLEMENTOR{x

  {cAssistant Imps are Immortals that the Imps feel can be trusted beyond a shadow
  {cof a doubt.  Their main duty is to assist the Implementors with the day to day
  running of the MUD, but they also are in charge of very critical or important parts
  {cof the MUD such as Area Building/Builders, the Wellfare of the Mortals, Overseeing
  the IMMs below them, etc...  An Assist Imp can also be relied upon to make fair, and
  usually reasonable, judgement calls for almost any given situation.  What that means
  is, if you are in doubt about something, or the answers you are getting from some of
  the other IMMs are confusing and/or do not make sense, an Assist Imp is the next best
  thing to talking directly to an Imp. 

  Also, to save yourself some time and heartache, what an Asst Imp says goes.  Do not
  bother asking another IMM about it as the ONLY ones that can override one of the 2
  Asst Imp are the IMPs themselves, so contact one of them if you are having a problem
  with an Asst Imp.
 
  In essense, the definition of an Assistant Implementor is simple:

  {g- {WIf the title of IMPLEMENTOR was not for the OWNERS ONLY, the ASST IMP would be one.
    So show them the same consideration you would show an IMP please.

{GGREATER GOD{g({GDESS{g){x

  {cDEMIs are usually the old timers of the MUD.  They have toiled their way through 
  {cthe Mortal levels{g({Wsome more than once{g){c and then were trusted enough to be promoted
  {cto Immortal,... After which they worked their tails off building or doing the grunt
  {cjobs the Imps/Asst Imps didn't want to do, like having to explain the rules over
  {cand over and over again to the mortals.  Finally
  {cand/or it was felt they could be trusted enough not to use their powers for evil
  {cmortal purposes, that they were rewarded by being promoted to this extremely, and 
  hard to get, exhaulted status.  Even though they still have to work their tails off
  doing grunt jobs, you can trust them to be helpful{g({Wmaybe{g){c, knowledgeable{g({Wsometimes{g){c
  and even friendly{g({Wdoubtful{g){c with the MUD in general.

  If, for any reason, an Asst. Imp quits the MUD forever, only a Greater God can be
  promoted to take their place.{x


{GLESSER GOD{g({GDESS{g) {cand {GDEMI{g-{GGOD{g({GDESS{g){x

  {cThis is the interm levels for the IMMORTALs.  What that means is, this is where
   the IMM must, and usually will, work their butts off.  LESSERs and DEMIs are here
   to help out Mortals, TRY and settle disputes, enforce Game Rules, TRY and explain
   Game Rules, assist the IMMs/IMPs above them, TRY and help out the BUILDERs, to
   act as go between for the MORTALs and IMMs if needed and anything else that might
   be needed for the MUD.  

   These are the 2 toughest titles to hold {g({WGame IMM{g-{Wwise{g){c, since an IMM of either of
   these 2 ranks knows enough about the MUD {g({Wor should{g){c that they can be asked to do
   long and sometimes boring jobs by the Upper-IMMs and at the same time, they have
   been here long enough that if they break an Immortal Rule, they are dealt with a
   bit harsher than a VET or a NEWBIE IMM.{x

  {cVets are those that have proven they can and will be useful to the MUD or their

  {creally do not need to keep trying to get EQ for themselves... {R;) {c.{x

-1 BUILDER BUILD~
{x
{GBUILDERS{x

  {cThese are the class of Immortal that build all of those wonderful areas that the
  players hack-n-slash MOBs in and explore.  A BUILDER can NOT see any public channels
  {g({Wincluding IMMTALK... Builders do have their OWN channel THOUGH, see below{g){c,
  they can NOT send or receive TELLs, are FOREVER invisible to a mortals eye, can NOT
  leave their assigned area or load a MOB or OBJ except from the same and a few other
  things that will be explained to the player IF they want to become a BUILDER AND get
  accepted as one.  All a BUILDER does is build.  

  If a player wants to become a GAME or even an ADMIN IMMORTAL, they do not have to be
  a BUILDER first.  It does help a GREAT deal as BUILDERs in good standing are given 
  FIRST consideration for ANY/ALL open IMM spots before just normal mortals.{x 
~

-1 IMMDOM1~
{x
   {cThe minimum requirements that MUST be met before consideration will be given 
   to a player for becoming a BUILDER or IMMORTAL are{w:

     {G- {WYou must have been playing KotRD for at least 1 month.
     {G- {WYou must be in 'good standing' with ALL of the current IMMs/IMPs.

              WILL need to straighten up before you apply{R **
     {G- {WYou either MUST be in your 20's (Age in RL) or have proven that you can
         and are mature enough for something like this.
     {G- {WThere needs to be an OPEN slot on the WIZLIST for the position you are
          applying for, 99% of the time this would be a VACANCY under the title of

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of ROM **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
6)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
7)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
8)  Do not try to overrule each other.

-1 RULES~
{cThe rules of Phoenix: RotRD are basic but {Wnon-negotiable.  {x
{c
Respect your fellow players and confine your insults to the IC
channels {W(VENT, CLAN, CLAN WAR, or ROLEPLAY).
{c
Remember this is a game, and the only permitted insults are in
character. Do not get too carried away.{x
{c
"Rule Lawyers" and/or those that take what is written below
and attempt to twist the meanings to suit themselves, will find 
that there is a NO tolerance attitude taken about this.  Just because 
it is not here word for word saying not to do it, does not mean you can!  
Do not argue and whine over IMM decisions, the IMMS do not want
to hear it, and not only will your punishement stand, but you will risk
lowering the level of mutual respect we hope to develop.{x
{c
Use a little common sense and maturity and all of us should have a 
great time...{x

0 DELETE~
{b
******************************************
{r
Syntax: delete
{r
Use the delete command to erase unwanted
characters, so the name will be available
for use. This command must be typed twice
to delete a character. Typing delete with
an argument will return your character to
'safe' status if you change your mind after
the first delete.
{b
******************************************{x
~

0 OUTFIT~
{b
******************************************
{r
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and
beloW, equips your character with a new set
of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet,
shield, and vest), courtesy of the Mayor's
warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are
affected.
{b
******************************************{x
~

0 AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
{b
******************************************
{r
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease 
the boredom of always splitting gold and
sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as
follows:
{r
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobs
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobs
autosac   : sacrifice dead monsters
(if autoloot is on, only empty corpses)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering
a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among
your group members
autoassist : makes you help group members
in combat
{r
Typing a command sets the action , typing
it again removes it.
{r
See also: help pcinfo, help descflags,
help conflags
{b
******************************************{x
~

-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~
AFFECTS AFFECT
             {b****************************************
{r       This command is used to show all the spells affecting 
      your' character. At low levels, only the spell name will 
       be displayed, at higher levels the effects and duration 
                of the spell will also be shown. 

            Spell effects are no longer shown on score 
          (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
             {b*******************{m*{b********************{x
~

-1 'GROUP HEADER'~
{CIf you are {cREMORTing{C and select a GROUP to add, you will be unable to DROP it.
{CWe will have this fixed as soon as possible but until then think carefully about
{Cwhich GROUPs you want to add.  Skills can be added and droped as normal, this note
{CONLY applies to selections on the GROUP chart.{x

{WThis list may be seen again by typing {RLIST{W.{x
~

-1 'GROUP HELP'~
The following commands are available:
list         display all groups and skills not yet bought
learned      show all groups and skills bought 
premise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups
add <name>   buy a skill or group
drop <name>  discard a skill or group
info <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group
help <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics
done	     exit the character generation process
~

-1 'MENU CHOICE'~
{RChoice {w({WADD,DROP,LIST,HELP{w){R? {x~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The ROM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.
~

-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
{b**************************************
{r
        Clerics are the warrior-priests and shamans of 
      the realm.Trained in both in the fighting arts, and
        magics of healing and protection. Clerics can
    be a force to be reckoned with, as with such spells as
     SANCTUARY and STONE SKIN, they may be easy to -hit-,
      but they're hard to -hurt-. Of course there is the 
   darker side to Clerical magic, and most will not hesitate
    to lay down rains of BLINDNESS and CURSE to make mighty
    warriors into blundering fools. Most clerics also learn at 
     one time or another to SCRIBE, the art of making spell 
                   scrolls good for one use.
{b
             {b**************************************{x
~

-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
{b          **************************************
{r
     Faceless shadows and ruthless footpads, Thieves
       are of the least respected classes in the
    realm. Making their living through stealing from
      others, they are naturally skilled at covert
      acts like PICK LOCK and STEAL. Reputed for a 
    lack of honor as well, a thief will not hesitate to 
      stab you in the back, or kick dirt in your eyes
   while fighting. Not completely without magic, Thieves 
     may also be trained to use the IDENTIFY spell to
   discern the exact workings of virtually anything. All
     in all, of the classes more skilled in fighting, 
   Thieves tend more well-rounded and versatile than any
                          other.

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
{b
******************************************
{r
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the
art of parrying with a shield. Characters
with no shield block skill will not be able
to defend themselves well with a shield.
Only Assassins, Warriors, Antipaladins,
Paladins, and Rangers may learn shield block.

~

-1 BACKSTAB~
{b
******************************************
{r
Backstab is the favored attack of thieves
and antipaladins.  It is necessary to 
wield a weapon which thrusts, pierces, stabs,
or slices to backstab. The amount of damage
inflicted by a backstab is determined by the
attacker's level, his weapon skill, his
backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.

~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 DISARM~
{b
******************************************
{r
Syntax: disarm
{r
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable
skill, designed to relieve your opponent
of his weapon.  The best possible chance
of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's
weapon. Talented thieves, warriors, paladins,
assassins, anti-paladins, and rangers may
learn this skill.
{b
******************************************{x
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
{b
******************************************
{r
Warriors, assassins, paladins, anti-paladins,
and rangers can become skilled enough in
combat that they are able to inflict more
damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is
checked for with each hit, although with a
low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.{b

******************************************{x
~

-1 ENVENOM~
{b
******************************************
{r
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill
practiced only by thieves, assassins, and
antipaladins, designed to win a battle
through alchemy and treachery rather than
skill or strength. Or, put another way,
its a skill used by the smart to kill the
foolish. Food, drink, and weapons may be
envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on
the consumer, and is unlikely to be more
than a minor inconvience (after all, the
typical adventurer could drink sewer water
with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned
weapon, on the other hand, can inflict serious
damage on an opponent as the poison burns
through his bloodstream.  But be careful,
blade venom evaporates quickly and is
rendered almost powerless by repeated
blows in combat.
{b
******************************************{x
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
{b
******************************************
{r
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the
lands of Midgaard. Learning this style of
fighting gives the player a weapon even
when disarmed -- bare hands. Trained hand
to hand experts are far more effective than
many swordsmen. Clerics and warriors are
the best at this skill, although any class
may learn it.
{b
******************************************{x
~

-1 KICK~
{b
******************************************
{r
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive
an extra attack in combat, a powerful kick.
However, a failed kick may throw an unwary
fighter off balance. Thieves, Assassins,
Paladins, Anti-Paladins, Warriors, and 
Rangers may learn kick.
{b
******************************************{x
~

-1 RESCUE~
{b
******************************************
{r
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And
when in combat, a warrior with the rescue
skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue
allows you to intercede in combat, protecting
weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully
the favor will be returned.  Success in
rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity,
and speed between the character and the
target. (note: you rescue a friend, not
the monster)
{b
******************************************{x
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 MARRY MARRIAGE SPOUSE SPOUSETALK DIVORCE~
Ah, the beautiful ceremony that occurs when someone loves another so much
that they wish to spend the rest of their lives together.  Unfortuneately,
it turns sour sometimes.  Whether you're wanting to marry, or be divorced,
it must be performed by an Immortal.  With marriage, comes the ability
to communicate exclusively to your spouse via your own private talkline.

101 Slay~
Syntax: slay (who) <option>

  Where the "option" is one of the predefined "slay types".  Your coder can
  set up new types for each person who has access to the slay command.  To
  set up a new type is fairly straight forward, there are three messages,
  one sent to you (as the one who used the slay command), one sent to the
  poor victim, and one sent to everyone else in the room.  There are a few
  variables you can set in your slay type, including your name, the
  victims name, the sex of each, things like 'him','her','his','hers',etc.
  The format for using these variables goes like this:

  (Keep in mind, that "ch" stands for the "character" who used the slay
  command, "arg2" is the victim, which I would think, is self-eplanatory)

    $n  Result is the name of 'ch'.  If 'ch' is not visible to the target
        character, result is the string 'someone'.

    $N  Result is the name of 'arg2' (considered as a victim).  If 'arg2'
        is not visible to the target character, result is the string
        'someone'.

    $e  Result is 'he', 'she', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $E  Result is 'he', 'she', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'arg2'
        (considered as a victim).

    $m  Result is 'him', 'her', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'ch'.
    $M  Result is 'him', 'her', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'arg2'
        (considered as a victim).

    $s  Result is 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $S  Result is 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending on the sex of 'arg2'
        (considered as a victim).

   A few examples follow:

    Rand
    Rand's balefire
    Siezing Saidin, you blast $N with a bolt of blazing balefire!
    Your vision goes negative as $n's searing bolt of balefire anhilates you!
    $n's blast of balefire rips $N from the pattern!

    In the above example, "Rand" means that only the character known as
    "Rand" can use this slay type, or will even see it as an option.

    "Rand's balefire" is the name of the slay option itself. The "Keyword"
    that you would use on the command line. *note* You can abbreviate the
    keyword as long as it's unique, exampe: "slay jonas balefire" would
    slay the poor slob jonas, using "Rand's balefire" as the slay option.

    The next three lines, are the "TO_CHAR" (to you) "TO_VICTIM" and
    "TO_ROOM" messages, with variables, that get sent to the appropriate
    people.

Upon death, you will find yourself resting at the Temple Courtyard quite
naked and divested of all spells that may have once been upon you, as
well as half the money in your beltpouch. You will also find you have

When this happens, go east to the Morgue where you can retrieve your
belongings from your corpse.
 
If you happen to have been killed by another player in a PK battle, you
will awake at the Temple Courtyard, but your corpse will remain at the

{cINTELLIGENCE{x is an attribute that determines how quickly you
learn skills and spells. The higher your intelligence, the fewer
practices you will need to raise a particular skill or spell to its
maximum (75%).

{cWISDOM{x is the attribute which determines how many practices you
will game with each new level.

{cDEXTERITY{x is the attribute that determines your skillfulness in
combat and in handling weapons. Skills such as {wCIRCLE{x, {wBACKSTAB{x,
and {wASSASSINATE{x require a high level of dexterity.

{cCONSTITUTION{x is the attribute which determines how many hitpoints
you will gain with each new level.

Each of these attributes can be trained at your guildmaster. The maximum
level of each attribute is determined by your character's race. Each
attribute can also be enhanced magically through armor effects and
spell effects.

{b**************************************{x
{r
       An oddity among the spellcasters, the Psionicist
        differs from Mages and Clerics in that instead
       of using the powers of mana to create effects, the
      Psionicist uses instead the power of its own mind to
    project will. More balanced than either of the other pure
     spellcasters, a Psionicist enjoys a wholly unique array
 of spells in all categories. With abilities such as CHAMELEON
        POWER and SHADOW FORM, skilled Psionicists may
    also blend in like thieves, and with HEIGHTEN SENSES, the
     world seems to slow down for a Psionicist as everything
       around becomes clearer,revealing things the naked 
                         eye cannot see.

        Masters of the silent blade, Assassins are
    trained much in the way of thieves, except instead
   of using their sneak and stealth to relieve others of 
      their possessions, the Assassin instead seeks 
   to relieve the wary of their lives. With ASSASSINATE
    a skilled assassin can fell the most powerful of 
  enemies with a single blow, and with
      ENVENOM, every blow can be a new lesson in pain.
      The rampaging Assassin should be wary though, as 
  these "one-hit-wonders" can't stand toe-to-toe with most
          fighting classes in one on one combat.

0 PALADIN~
A curious combination of both Warrior and Cleric, Paladins are the hands and executors of the gods,
able to handle situations both physical and magical through perseverance and faith. Like their priestly
counterparts, Paladins learn the healing and protective arts, though not nearly to the same degree,
armed with magic such as {YSANCTUARY{x and {YHEAL{x. Also, every Paladin spends time with the Warriors,
learning the ways of the blade. Like Warriors, Paladins may become {YWEAPONMASTERS{x, but their most
devastating fighting skill lies in {YCRITICAL STRIKE{x, in which the Paladin calls upon the gods to guide
its hands to a truly awe-inspiring blow.

0 antipaladin~
{b         **************************************
{r
        The other face on the Paladin coin, the 
     Antipaladin is a combination of Warrior, Thief,
     and the darker side of priestly magic, serving
         the gods of chaos and evil. With spells 
    like FORSAKE and HARM, an Antipaladin can quickly 
     spell a large opponent down to its level, where
         it may easily take it on with fighting 
       prowess. Practical instead of Honorable, an
  Antipaladin will easily stoop to a BACKSTAB or poison
         weapons, and more often than not they 
      will fly into a zealous rage, lashing out at
             anyone who is foolish enough to 
        get within sight. Like other warrior melds,
            Antipaladins also have access to 
                 the WEAPONMASTER group.

    Literally forces of nature, Rangers are saddled
      with the burden of protecting the wilds from
   ever-encroaching 'civilization.' Capable of combat, 
     stealth, and detection magic, Rangers are able
      to cope with many situations. Mostly though,
 they are still a fighting class and their unique skills 
     certainly help them with combat. These include
  COMPANION, which allows a Ranger to call to the wilds
    for a creature to aid him in his quests, and the 
    fearsome WHIRLWIND which whirls the Ranger like a
     dervish, weapon extended, laying waste to the
     most resilient of foes. Also possessed only by
    Rangers is the lost art of tracking, which allows
          them to trace the scent of nearly any 
              creature in the known world.

Virtually any class can learn second attack,
where third attack is reserved only for those

Warriors, masters of combat, will ever have a
chance of learning fourth attack. Spells such as
Haste may also grant a temporary bonus strike,
giving the possibility of up to five attacks in
one single round of combat.

0 ELF~
{x
Many would think that the Elves are just forest-dwelling frolickers who
would rather play than do anything worthwhile, but this reputation is
undeserved.  While more frail than other races, the pointy-eared elves are
frighteningly quick and don't hesitate to use this to their advantage. 
Recently though as "society" has expanded towards the ancestral homes of the
elves, more and more are filtering into the cities, where they are quickly
earning new reputations as thieves and assassins.  Elves may be of any
class.

0 SUCCUBUS INCUBUS~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
Spawned from the planes of Hades, the Succubi
are tempter-level demons sent to provoke men
to mortal sin. They are hauntingly beautiful,
and many a man has been lured away by just a
look from one of these damned souls given 
flesh. Their looks however should not decieve
you into thinking them weak, as these creatures
are stronger, faster, and more durable than most
other races. Succubi make excellent Warriors,
Antipaladins, Thieves, and Assassins. They
also have the ability to become Mages. Incubi
are the male counterparts to Succubi, and are
largely identical.

0 CAMBION~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
The halfling offspring of a Demon and a Human,
Cambions are easily identifiable from their 
dark-tinted skin and ashen hair. Towering 
creatures, Cambions are powerhouses in combat,
able to absorb damage as well as they can lay
it out. Like most demons however, they aren't
overly bright, though if put to task they are
well-capable of magic. Cambions excel as 
Warriors, Thieves, and Assassins. They also 
make decent Clerics, Mages, and Enchanters.
{b
*********************************************{x
~

0 DWARF~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
Though short and stout, Dwarves are well-known
through the realm as carrying the attitude of
the most ornery giants. Dwarves are of the 
most resilient of all races, able to take long
barrages of attacks, both physical and magical, 
and still come out swinging like mad. Lacking
nowhere except in size, Dwarves also have a
reputation as healers, and many become Clerics
or Paladins without equal. Dwarves also may be
Thieves, Assassins,Antipaladins, or Enchanters.
Their inherent resistance to energy magic
however, prevents them from becoming Mages.
{b
*********************************************{x
~

0 GIANT~
{x
Enormous in both size and strength, Giants tower over all but Titans and
some Golems.  The earth shakes when they step, and to them, human-sized
weapons may as well be toothpicks.  As large creatures, Giants enjoy a
durability that surpasses that of the dwarves, against slashing weapons
especially.  The achilles heel of the Giant is in its intelligence, which is
often very low, leaving them vulnerable to mental attack.  Giants make
renowned warriors, and in the most intelligent of the species, excellent
Paladins and Antipaladins.  No giant, however, is ever capable of becoming a
full spellcaster.
~

0 LIZARDMAN~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
From the swamps and marshes of the world, the
tribal Lizardmen are a largely sinister race
that likes to fight dirty, notorious for using
their tails to sweep the feet out from under
their opponents, among other things. Physically,
Lizardmen are stronger, quicker, and more
durable than humans, giving them an advantage
in combat. Mentally, they aren't far behind the 
early human culture that they mimic, and have 
long since developed their own formulas and
magics. Some say that the indomitable will
of the Lizardmen makes them resistant to 
mental attacks, though this has not yet been
proven. Thief, Warrior, and Assassin are all
good class choices for this race, and some
Lizardmen have been known to become Clerics 
or even Rangers.
{b
*********************************************{x
~

0 TITAN~
{x
Noble beings descended from the heavens of Olympus,Titans have the blood
of the gods themselves running through them, giving them superior physical
and mental abilities.  Also, as they are so linked to divinity, Titans enjoy
resistance to the plagues and poisons most mortals have to deal with.  Even
multiple wounds will not stop a Titan for long, as the blood of the ancients
quickly sears closed the flesh, and given a few minutes these giants will be
ready to fight anew, just as hard and fierce as the first time.  Their
natural-born abilites make them superb Warriors, Paladins, and Antipaladins,
and being no slouches mentally either, Titans may elect to become Mages,
Clerics, or Enchanters as well.
~

0 MINOTAUR~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
Once thought only to be a unique creature of
legend, these bull-headed humanoids are indeed
their own race from the northern reaches of the
realm. Physically strong but mentally weak,
Minotaurs are savage in combat, flying into
berserk rage at even the slightest hint of 
blood, giving them the ability to go toe-to-toe
with even races such as Giants.However they are
not without their shortcomings, and their lack
of willpower makes them vulnerable to spellcasters
and their weavings. Minotaurs also lack the
concentration to develop any advanced skill,
and may only become Warriors.

0 TROLL~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
Gruesome creatures, Trolls are tall and lanky,
with elongated noses and sunken eysockets.
Their skin ranges from olive to a sickly green,
and any hair they have is inky jet. For their
size they are powerful creatures, possessing
great strength and an absolute refusal to die.
Trolls are also inhumanly quick, and most can
rain down a hail of attacks that will kill most 
opponents outright. Strangely, as hard as Troll
skin is to cut, it burns like paper, and most
Trolls will go running the other way at the
sight of torches. Trolls aren't known for
intelligence, either, and thus may only be
Warriors and Assassins.
{b
*********************************************{x
~

0 GOLEM~
{x
"Born" as magical constructs in wizard laboratories, Golems are not
actually "alive" at all.  Instead they are beings created from materials,
given life through spellcasting wizards, usually to perform repetative tasks
or to serve as guards.  However, some of these enslaved creatures break free
of their bonds and leave their creators to seek their own lives and their
own personalities.  Being almost elemental in nature, Golems are extremely
strong and resilient, but unfortunately, as they are mechanical,they tend to
be slow and have less than average intelligence.  Golems make for excellent
Warriors, mediocre assassins, and the most intelligent of their kind have
become Paladins and Antipladins.
~

0 SIDHE ELF~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
Sidhe (pronounced like She) are not really
elves at all. Instead the Sidhe are the 
spell-slingers of the faerie-realm, the "elf"
part of their name tacked on by the other races
of the realm, as they look very similar. In 
truth the Sidhe Elves are creatures of magic,
with mana bound to every fiber of their being,
even running through their very blood.Masterful
in their spellcasting, the Sidhe are a race 
with little equal, having both average strength
and resilience and unsurpassed mental and
dexterous ability. They make unparalleled
spellcasters, with the Sidhe able to be Mages,
Clerics, Psionicists, and Enchanters. Sidhe
also have a sense of the Wilds and Nature, 
giving them a natural affinity towards Rangers.

0 DARKELF~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
Twisted cousins of the forest-dwelling elves,
the race now called the Dark Elves lives
underground, where they were exiled to many
years ago for some unknown crime against their
former brothers. Their many years outcast in the 
hostile caverns of the realm has turned them into
a twisted, spiteful race, who hate all who live
above. Dark Elves, like their surface dwelling
cousins, are physically weaker than most races,
but make up for this with their immense knowledge
and lightning dexterity. The Dark Elves excel as 
spellcasters, and may become Mages, Clerics, and
Enchanters. They also make good Assassins and
Antipaladins, and some numbers of them become
renowned Warriors.

~

0 KENDER~
{b
*********************************************{x
{r
The origin of the Kender is still sketchy at
best, and the only people that truly know,
the Kender themselves, aren't telling. Kender
are, curiously, short and resistant like
dwarves but slender and quick like elves. The
very thing this suggests however will get you
slapped by any elf or dwarf. Kender however 
don't care. About much of anything, in fact.
They live carefree lives, amused and in 
wonder of everything, much like a child. The
Kender never seem to settle down, almost 
nomadic in their ways, but this is not the 
strangest thing about them. Kender seem to have
a compulsion to "borrow" things that aren't
theirs. They honestly don't intend to do this,
but calling a Kender a thief is the -only-
sure way to piss them off. They -do- make 
excellent thieves though, and very 
competent assassins and rangers. They are 
also capable of becoming warriors.

*********************************************{x
~

0 MYRDDRAAL~
{x
Once servants of the Elven Highlords, the unnatural Myrddraal trace roots
back to Hades and the plane of the Dead as well.  Created in some twisted
wizard's sense of perfection, the Myrddraal carry many powers innate which
would normally require sorcery.  Their unusual form grants immunity to many
forms of attack, and their sinister nature and natural stealth gives them a
natural aptitude for dirty tricks such as assassination.  Myrddraal are
physically superior to even Giants, and more dextrous than the mysterious
Sidhe.  Now they are free of their bondage, and set upon the world to exact
revenge for their torment.  Thankfully not without vulnerability, a
Myrddraal is succeptible to most common weaponry, and is not created with
but rudimentary intelligence.  Myrddraal may be Warriors, Thieves,
Assassins, or Antipaladins.

An invaluable power in the hands of any

a sudden burst of strength that rivals the {cGIANT STRENGTH{x spell, but unlike the Magely

One of few helpful manipulations that can

Psionicist itself, Enhance Armor strengthens
the molecular bonds in pieces of armor, making
them stronger and more resistant to blows.
This power however is not perfect, and for
some reason cannot affect armor that has a magic

Psionic's level.

A manipulation upon obfuscate, the power of

Only one is the true image, however, and a 
Psionic with this power active enjoys a bonus
to both Dexterity and Armor. This spell 
is self-use only.

0 AWE~
{x
{YSyntax: {xcast '{wawe{x'

A curious power, the {CAWE{x manipulation reaches into the minds of all those around the
Psionicist, ripping their ideal hero figure from their mind and fooling their eyes into
thinking that it is in fact, their hero that they are facing in battle. In most cases this
ceases all combat for the duration of the power as everyone is awestruck by the person
they are facing.

{W** LAST PART OF RULES**
{W
*{cDo NOT abuse bugs. If you come across a bug, please note it to
IMMORTAL. Do not discuss bugs on chat or abuse them. If you are
found to be abusing a bug, reported or unreported,  you will be
severely punished.
{W
** IMMORTAL PUNISHMENTS **
{W
* {cThere are essentially four classes of players here:
    - Mortals (You the Player)
    - Immortals (Someone Powerful)
    - Assistant Implementors (Someone Incredibly Powerful)
    - Implementors (Their Power is Infinite within KotRD)
 {W
* {cFor mortals, you are required to follow all directions given you by 
an IMM,  an ASST IMP or an IMP.  An IMMORTAL can give you any
 punishment they want,  for any reason.
 {W
* {cImmortals can not override other Immortals' punishments once they
 have been  given, so do not try and get a second IMM involved in the 
hopes of getting  bailed out!  The ONLY exception to this is that ASST
 IMPs may override IMMs and IMPs may override anyone except fellow IMPS.
{W
     {c- Do not ARGUE over punishments given to you. Arguing over a
 punishment will most likely make the punishment more severe. IMPS
decisions are FINAL. Direct ANY and ALL queries regarding  your
 punishment directly to the immortal punishing you, do not whine to the
ASST IMPs or IMPs.  Whining may get you  FURTHER punishment.  
 {W    
 ** The Bottom Line **
 {c
We try to allow the maximum amount of freedom here for all of the
 players to enjoy the game.  Immortals are usually players who have
significantly contributed to KotRD and, accordingly, have earned
the powers that they wield.  Mortals, in general, do not have a right
to complain about minor punishments (such as nochanneling, jailing,
 etc.) for a reasonable amount of time.  Public complaints do nothing
but ruin the enjoyment of other players and will not be tolerated. 
Private complaints should go directly to the person punishing you,
or, if you feel the punishment is unjust, to the ASST IMPs/IMPs.
Be warned that the ASST IMPs/IMPs will usually allow the IMMs 
to exercise their power in most circumstances, so complaints
about IMM punishments should be reserved for EXTREME cases.{x

0 link-death link-dead link~
Sometimes the internet is not all that it is cracked up to be, and
occasionally your connection to the gameport will drop.  
 
This is called link-death.
 
If you go link-dead while fighting a mob, you will automatically recall.
However, if you are in a PK battle with a player, your character
will continue fighting.

In your link-dead state, your character may die.  Unfortunately this is a
risk that is undertaken, and there are no reimbursements of experience or
items if this should happen.
 
If you are not fighting when you go link-dead, you may only miss out on a
few tells that were sent in your absence.  To see the tells you received,
type the 'replay' command when you have reconnected.

0 alias~
Syntax: alias
Syntax: alias <word> <substitution>
Syntax: unalias <word>
 
The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.
 
Aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one
command.  Each player may assign up to 20 aliases.
 
To create an alias, use the 'alias <word> <substitution> syntax.
For example, to set a quick alias to get all items from a corpse, you
could use:
 
{walias gc get all corpse{x
 
This equates the simple 'gc' to the command 'get all corpse.'
 
Remember, the first word (or abbreviation) you type after the 'alias'
command becomes the alias.  Everything that follows it must be a command
you can use.
 
If you want to delete an alias you have created, type 'unalias <alias>'

In order for staves, potions, scrolls and wands to work, you must use a
particular command.  In the case of staves, scrolls and wands, you must
also have a minimum amount of ability in each particular skill area.
 
Here is how to use each item:
 
{cBRANDISH{x : while holding a magical stave (staff), type 'brandish.'
 
{cQUAFF{x    : put the potion you would like to ingest in your
           inventory and 'quaff' it.
 
{cRECITE{x   : invokes the power of a magical scroll. Magic on scrolls
           can be directed at yourself, or toward other players, mobs
           or items.  If the target of your spell is someone or something
           other than yourself, use 'recite <scroll> <target>.'
 
{cZAP{x      : releases the spell from a magic wand.  If you use this
           skill in combat, it will be used against your opponent.

0 scrolls~
Scrolls are pieces of parchment inscribed with magic by powerful beings.
The chance to gain the ability to use scrolls is offered only to Mages,
Clerics, Psionics, Paladins, Anti-Paladins, and Enchanters.  
 
To use a scroll, use the RECITE command.  Be careful!  The magic on a
scroll is not always obvious and scrolls should be carefully examined
before use.
 
Some magicians are so powerful that they can create their own scrolls.

monster have been killed lately, and some random variation.

Skills are types of abilities that you can choose, or are 'born' with,
which help you make your way in the world.  Each class has a set of
skills available to them which help to set them apart from differing
classes.  Examples of the types of skills on {RPhoenix{x are individual
weapons skills, skills involving magical items, combat skills such
as circle or backstab, and non-combat skills such as haggle or peek.
 
To see the skills your character has, type the 'skills' command. The
percentage next to each skill represents how well you have learned that
skill.  When the number reaches 100%, you have mastered that skill.

It is possible to add to your set of skills after your character
is created.  A guildmaster can help you gain additional skills if
you possess the requisite creation points.

Skills improve through practice and use.  It is recommended that you
practice a skill until you have 'learned' it (75%).  From that point
on, using the skill either actively or passively will slowly increase
your ability.

0 remort remorting~
When a player reaches Hero status (Level 100), he or she has the option
to start a new life, choosing a new race and class while retaining some
of the attributes, such as skills and spells, from their original
incarnation.

In general, Remort characters are much more powerful than non-
remorts.  Remorting is also a chance to round out you character's
skills and abilities.
 
In order to Remort, a Hero must have at least 4000 quest points.  He or
she must then find the Remort Portal, which will appear randomly
somewhere on the MUD.  Then the Hero simply enters the portal, and
begins anew.

0 quest questing quests~
Quests are challenges to a player to either find and return a special
item, or kill a nefarious monster.  Successfully completed quests are
rewarded with {Ygold{x and {wQuest Points{x (QP).  To be sent on a quest,
find the Questmaster in Midgaard.  The QUEST commands are as follows:
 
{cQUEST REQUEST{x  : This command petitions the Questmaster to send you
                 on a quest. If you are given a quest to perform, you
                 will be given a time limit (in minutes) within which
                 you must complete the quest.  The item you must find,
                 or the monster you must kill, will have a [TARGET]
                 flag before its name.
 
{cQUEST COMPLETE{x : Once you have killed your target monster or found
                 your quest item, return to the Questmaster and type the
                 'quest complete' command. If you are truly successful,
                 the Questmaster will reward you. You may then request
                 another quest after a 10-minute waiting period.
 
{cQUEST TIME{x     : This command shows you the time remaining in your
                 current quest (if you are questing), or the time you
                 must wait before requesting another quest (if you are
                 not currently questing).
 
{cQUEST INFO{x     : If you are on a quest, this command will remind you
                 of what your task is, if you have forgotten.
 
{cQUEST POINTS{x   : This command shows you your current number of quest
                 points.  Quest points are also shown in your score.
 
{cQUEST LIST{x     : Using this command in the Questmaster's chamber
                 displays a list of fabulous items for sale, which can
                 be purchased only with quest points.
 
{cQUEST BUY{x      : To purchase an item from the Questmaster, type
                 'quest buy <item>'.  The QP price of the item will be
                 deducted from your total amount of quest points.
 
Quest points are also necessary to Remort your character once it reaches
Hero level.

0 money gold silver~
The economy on {RPhoenix{w:{rReturn of the Red Dragon{x is based on gold
and silver coinage.  {YGold{x coins are worth 100 {wSilver{x coins, but are
four times as heavy - 25 gold pieces to the pound, versus 100 silver pieces
to the pound.  Gems can be purchased at the jeweler to alleviate weight
problems, at a slight premium.  To protect your money from thieves and
death, you may choose to deposit some of your wealth in the Midgaard Bank,
located {c2s, 3w, 2n, 3e, s{x from recall.  Also see help for: BANK 
~

0 bank banking~
The Bank is a safe place in the realm to deposit your gold and silver. 
The bank protects your money from thieves, losses if you should happen to
die, and the inevitable weight problems associated with carrying so much
coin in your beltpouch.  
 
Most everyone uses the {cBank of Midgaard{x, which can be found on the
Clan Road in Midgaard.  Thieves and Assassins must use their {cGuild Bank{x.
 
The banking commands (below) are also helpfully provided on signs at
each bank:
 
{cDEPOSIT{x {w# <cointype>{x  : takes a specified amount of silver or gold out
                        of your beltpouch and puts it into your account.
 
{cWITHDRAW{x {w# <cointype>{x : deducts a specified amount of silver or gold
                        from your bank account, given to you in coins.
 
{cWORTH{x                 : displays your bank balance in gold and silver
                        as well as the amount of money in your beltpouch
 
{cACCOUNT{x               : displays the same information as WORTH
 
{cBANKSHOW{x              : toggles your bank display in your score.

0 death_field~
Syntax: cast 'death field'
 
Only the darkest of the Psionics dare even think of using this power.
Using a cruel perversion of telepathy, the Psionic sends out a mental
signal across a cloud of black energy to all in the immediate area,
causing nearby minds to sever their own neural connections. Most targets
of this power barely escape with a severe amount of damage and some
amount of retardation, but a few very unlucky ones have vital nerves cut
off, effectively euthanizing them.
~

0 clan clans~
A Clan is a collection of players united to follow and further a common
cause.  To join a clan, you must be between level 20 and level 40.
 
To see a list of clans available on {RPhoenix{x, type 'clan'. To learn
more about a specific clan, type 'clan <clanname>'.  If you are
interested in joining a clan, speak to the clan's leader, who will
explain any requirements you must fulfill before joining the ranks.
 
Be advised, joining a clan is a dangerous step.  As a member of a clan,
other clanned players can kill you or steal from you. Many adventurers
live to kill and torture others and chances are that your paths will
cross.
 
Attacking or killing your fellow clan-members is illegal, except to
mutiny your Clan leader.

0 dragonpit dp~
The Dragonpit is an arena-style opportunity for combatting your fellow
players outside the auspices of clans or PK.  A Dragonpit is for fun
only (as well as bragging rights) and those who lose their lives in the
Pit suffer no reduction of experience.
 
Only an Immortal can start a Dragonpit.  Occasionally the Pit is
restricted by level and there may be an entry fee of some kind. To join
a Dragonpit, you must type the 'dragonpit' command while entry is open.
~

0 PK player_killing~
Clanned players run the risk (or, some would say, opportunity...) of
engaging in combat with other clanned players.  This type of battle
is known as PK, or 'player killing.'
 
If a player engaged in PK loses the fight and dies, not only is there a
loss of experience (as in normal combat) but the winner of the battle
may take items from the loser's corpse, which remains at the spot where
the player died.
 
There are level ranges enforced to keep PK somewhat fair, and to prevent
very high level players attacking those who are much lower level.
 
The ranges are (victim vs. attacker):
 
{cMortal {wvs. {cMortal{w:  10 level range
{cRemort {wvs. {cMortal{w:  20 level range
{cRemort {wvs. {cRemort{w:  10 level range

Syntax: cast nexus <target>
Syntax: cast portal <target>
 
The {cnexus{x and {cportal{x spells are types of sophisticated transport
magic which create a one-way or two-way temporary doorway to another
location.
 
In casting either spell, you must target a monster or a player, and both
spells require an additional component, held in the caster's hand.
 
Though much mystery surrounds the substance needed for these highly
powerful spells, it is believed that it is some type of rare and magical
mineral.
 
The portal spell is available to Mages, Thieves, Assassins, Warriors,
and Anti-Paladins.  The nexus spell is available only to Mages.

                 closed or locked doors.

                 player or mobile.
 
{cteleport{x       : a somewhat risky but highly interesting transport
                 spell that sends the caster to a random location in the
                 realm.

0 wimp wimpy~
Syntax: wimp <number>
 
The wimp command sets your wimpy value.  The number referenced in the
command syntax refers to a set level of hit points. When your character
takes damage that reduces your hit points, you will automatically try to
flee whenyour hit points remaining are {wbelow{x your wimpy value. You
will only flee if your character is not in a 'wait state' -- ie, has
not been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not
been tripped or bashed by an enemy.
 
The wimp command with no number argument sets your wimpy value to 20%
of your maximum hit points.
 
Your wimpy value is shown in your score. If you do not set a wimpy value
the default is zero.

0 hitpoints hp~
Your character's hit points (hp) are a measure of the maximum amount of
damage that your character is able to take.  You can increase your max
hitpoints through leveling, using different types of equipment, and
training them at your Class Guildmaster.
 
Damage taken in combat, as well as the effects of some spells, decrease
your current hitpoints but not your maximum hitpoints.
 
To regain hitpoints after damage reduces them, you can sleep or rest,
recieve healing, or use magical artifacts with a healing spell.

0 mana~
Mana is a measure of magical power. Any character who uses magic will
need a bit of mana to make it work.  Your maximum mana can be increased
through leveling, using different types of equipment, and training your
mana at your Class Guildmaster.
 
Using magic reduces your current mana.
 
To regain spent mana, you can sleep or rest or heal your mana at the
Temple healer.  The {wmeditate{x skill is also useful for heavy magic
users.
 
Also see help for: HP, MOVES, TRAIN
~

0 moves~
Moves, or movement, is a measure of how much energy you have to continue
moving about.  Your maximum moves can be increased through leveling,
using different types of equipment, and training your movement at your
Class Guildmaster.
 
Walking from place to place uses up movement, and different types of
terrain have different reductionary effects. Some types of combat also
decrease your current moves.
 
To regain spent moves, you can sleep or rest, or have the {wrefresh{x
spell cast upon you.
 
Also see help for: HP, MANA, TRAIN
~

0 train training~
Training sessions are a way to increase your stats (strength, wisdom,
intelligence, dexterity and constitution) and your hitpoints, mana and
moves.
 
Each time you gain a level, you are awarded with one training session.
 
You must be at a guildmaster to train your attributes. Use the 'train'
command followed by the attribute you wish to train.  Each session
costs one training point.
 
Training points are also equivalent to Creation Points, and can be saved
and used later to gain spell groups or skills that you did not choose
during character creation.  You can also convert training points to
practices.  One training point equals 10 practices, and vice versa.

Syntax: holylight
Syntax: wizinvis <level>
 
Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character
and mobile in the game. With holy light on, you can see what's in the
game more easily. Without holy light, you can see what mortal players
see.
 
Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all
players of a lower level than your invisibility level. It defaults to
the maximum (eg your level) if no argument is given. Wizi 500 immortals

0 invis mass_invis~
Syntax: cast invis <target>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'
 
The invis and mass-invis spells are ways to beguile other players and
monsters by cloaking your presence from them. The {winvis{x spell can be
cast without an argument to affect only the caster, or at a target to
cloak them. Invis can also be used on objects such as armor or a weapon.
 
Mass invis is useful when a player is grouped with one or more other
players. When cast, it will render the entire team invisible.
 
Keep in mind, some players and monsters can see invisible and some
shopkeepers will not deal with invisible customers. Also, a player who
is invis and engages in combat will immediately revert to being visible.
 
The invis spell is available to Mages and Assassins. Mass invis is
available only to Clerics.

0 mage magic~
The life of the enigmatic Mage is one of books and study, as is
required for their wide array of spells. Mages are the most combat-
oriented of the spellcasting classes, well versed in every spell that
somehow causes harm, in every way, and with every element thinkable.
 
Mages derive their powers from the flow of mana, tapping into it to
reveal the unseen, disappear on a whim, and enhance their power with
powerful protective magic.
 
Of all the classes, Mages are weakest in hand-to-hand combat, and if a
fighter gets too close, a Mage may become quickly overwhelmed.

0 bash~
Syntax: bash <target>
 
The bash skill is a brute-force ability designed to knock your foe to
his knees. Its success depends on many factors, including how skilled
the user is at bashing, the user's weight, and the size of one's
opponent.
 
Bash lags its user a small amount in combat, and an unsuccessful bash
lags its user even more.
 
The bash skill is available to Warriors, Paladins, and Anti-Paladins.
~

0 trip~
Syntax: trip <target>
 
Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, involving the use of any one of
a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground. Trip
can be partially successful (inflicting a small amount of damage), or
fully successful (bringing one's opponent to the ground, leaving them
unable to retaliate for several rounds).
 
Thieves, Assassins, Warriors, Anti-Paladins and Rangers all may learn
the trip skill.
~

0 ultrablast~
Syntax: cast ultrablast
 
An advanced form of Psionic Blast, the power of ultrablast allows the

0 warrior~
The most basic of classes, Warriors are the brutal masters of melee.
Warriors can take more punishment than any other class, and in combat
they also deal the most, with such skills as bash and fourth attack.
 
Warriors also have access to the weaponmaster group, which gives them
skill in all types of melee weaponry, including exotic weapons.
 
The warrior's one shortcoming is in magic. They are only able to learn
two spells, but those two spells - {wsharp blade{x and {wgiant strength{x -
make the class all the more fearsome weapon-to-weapon. To warriors,
if it bleeds, they can kill it.

often conceal treasures behind them.
 
To open or close a door, use a direction as your argument. To open or
close an object, such as a chest or backpack, use the item name as your
argument

or forsaken locations. Also, players who are affected by a curse cannot
recall. It is not possible to recall out of a battle.
 
A forward-slash (/) is synonymous with recall.

0 rom code~
ROM was started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of
1993, ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM. ROM was
set up for a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was
released, and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of
Mud under a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.
 
Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.
 
The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

{cBug reports{x - Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will
Hongach, Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington
(author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs.
 
The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the
originator of the ASCII flags used in the zone files.
 
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead MUD, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there. Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. Portions of Rusty's work on
Moosehead also remain.
 
The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened. In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and wiznet

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

0 save quit~
Syntax: save
Syntax: quit

The command {wsave{x saves your character and your possessions. The game
also auto-saves every 15 minutes. However, some objects in your inventory,
such as keys, may not be saved.
 
The {wquit{x command ends your game session. You may quit anywhere in
the world that you like, and when you log back on to Phoenix, you will
commence your new session from where you last left.
 
Using {wquit{x automatically does a {wsave{x, so you can safely leave the
game with just one command. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to save before
you quit. If you get into the habit of using quit without save, and then
play another MUD that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to
regret it.
 
There is no 'rent' on this MUD. Just {wsave{x and {wquit{x whenever you want
to leave.

0 sacrifice~
Syntax: sacrifice
 
Sacrifice offers an object or a corpse to Mota, who may reward you. The
nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.

To automatically sacrifice the corpse of every monster you kill
you can toggle your '{wautosac{x' setting to its on-state.

0 loot~
Syntax: get all <target>
Syntax: get <item> <target>
 
Quite often, a monster you kill will have some items left in its corpse
which are yours for the taking.  To get everything in the corpse left
behind, use 'get all corpse'. If you are only interested in specific
items, use 'get <item> corpse'.
 
Once you are done with a monster, it is polite to {wsacrifice{x it to Mota,
to prevent piles of corpses from filling the lands and fouling the air.
 
To get everything from a monsters corpse after every kill automatically,
simply toggle '{wautoloot{x' to its on-state. To assure that you have also
gotten all the gold a monster leaves behind after its death, toggle
'{wautogold{x' to its on-state. You can toggle them off at any time.

If you are unsure where to start, you should first go through Mudschool
(up and north from the Temple Square) to gain experience to face the
trials that await you outside. Be sure to practice your weapon in the
Guild room, or your stay with us will be very short indeed.
 
Type the '{wequipment{x' command to see what you are wearing and wielding.
You may also want to check your {winventory{x where you will see a Dragon
Bag full of items to help you on your way.

Syntax: practice
Syntax: practice <skill | spell>
 
The {wpractice{x command without an argument tells you your current ability
level in all the skills and spells available to you. You can check this
anywhere.

The {wpractice{x command with an argument (either a skill or spell name)
practices that particular skill or spell. You can practice skills and
spells up to its learned level (75%), after which you must use it to
improve upon it.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your wisdom, the more practices you will gain at
each level. Unused sessions are saved until you use them, and they can
be converted to train points if you so choose.

The gain commands can be used at your Guildmaster to add skills and
spellgroups to your character that were not chosen during creation.
Gain uses training sessions (synonymous with creation points). Skills and
spells that you gain at the Guildmaster do not increase your total
experience-to-level or total number of creation points.

                  of 'gain points' costs 2 training sessions. It is

The most numerous and diverse race in the realm, Humans are the norm by
which all other races are judged. Physically and mentally unremarkable
and average, the strength of the Humans lies in their adaptability and
lack of any real weakness. Humans are able to pick up virtually anything
if they set their mind and time to it, and thus may be of any class.

The {wfollow{x command will start you following another character. To
stop following someone, {wfollow{x yourself.
 
{wGroup <character>{x makes someone who is following you a member of your
group. Group members share experience points from killing monsters and
may use the {wgtell{x channel and the {wsplit{x commands. If anyone in
your group is attacked, all other members of the group will automatically
join the fight.
 
To ungroup a character, using the {wgroup <character>{x command will
remove him or her from your group. Characters can also leave the group
by using the {wfollow self{x command to stop following you.
 
The {wgroup{x command with no argument shows statistics for each group
member.
 
You may group only with characters who are within nine levels of you.

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader. It allows a character
to match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for
merchandise, or to buy at the lowest possible cost. Unfortunately, most
merchants are already very skilled at haggling, so the untrained haggler
had best guard his treasure closely. Thieves are natural masters at
haggling, althought other classes may learn the skill as well.

The {wbuy{x command buys an object from a shopkeeper. To purchase
multiple numbers of the same object in a shopkeeper's inventory, use
the {wbuy <#>*<object>{x command, where # is the quantity of the item
you want.
 
The {wbuy{x command with an object argument defaults to the first item
on the shopkeeper's list with that keyword. To choose a specific item
from a list which includes many different items of the same name, use
the {wbuy <#>.<object>{x command, where # is the nth occurence of that
item on the list.
 
If you want to buy multiple numbers of an object which has several
occurences on the shopkeeper's list, use {wbuy <#>*<#>.<object>{x, where
the first # argument is the quantity you desire and the second # specifies
that keyword's occurence on the list.

0 fallen~
Long ago, when the world was first created, and the races had begun to
disperse throughout the land, the Gods knew that the fledgling races would
need help in surviving and coping, until they settled in. So the Gods sent
a number of Angels down from the heavens to teach, help, and protect the
fledgling races.
 
And for a time, the Angels did exactly that: they taught, they helped, and
they protected all races from harm. After a while, though, the Angels began
to look at some of the races in a different light, and saw the beauty in
them, and they fell prey to their lusts.
 
Thus, the Nephilim were born.
 
 The Gods were not pleased with the Angels; they had succumbed to mortal
emotion. However, the Gods knew it was not the fault of the Nephilim.
They were just the offspring - nothing had been in their control. Instead
of slaying the Nephilim, the Gods decided to wait and see what they would
do. They could not be  brought into Heaven, and the Gods did not wish to
slay them. They became the Fallen Ones.
 
While they were able, the Angels taught the Nephilim all they knew, until
such time as the Gods took their vengeance upon the Angels, and the Angels
disapeared. After this, the Nephilim began to wander, not feeling like
part of the world in which they existed. Half Angel or Demon, Half Mortal,
the Nephilim actually did not exist wholly in this plane. For a long time
the Nephilim wandered around the world, until they came upon the only
enemy they have ever known who could match them. The word spread quickly
among the Nephilim, for they were always able to converse with another, 
no matter the distance.
 
They then gathered at a secret location, known only as the Nephilim 
Stronghold, where they prepared for battle. For an age it seemed the
Nephilim waged war with this enemy, until finally, the enemy was defeated.
From then on, many Nephilim wandered the land as they had before, but some
also stayed at the Nephilim Stronghold, for it had been decided that a
central gathering point was a good idea, and this was ideal.
 
Over time, the Nephilim developed an interesting Hierarchy.  The Master
and The Student. The Nephilim as a whole are a race that love to learn,
they are eternally curious about the workings of life, and are as wise as
can be. They show respect to almost all things, and have decided to follow
the original Creed set forth for the Angels: To Help, Teach, and Protect.
 
Now the Nephilim know that fighting is inevitable, but almost as a rule,
do not initiate combat without good reason. If a Nephilim is attacked,
however, the attacker can expect the wrath of the entire race to follow
them to their demise.
 
The Master and Student relationship is an interesting one, as the Master
is not always older than the Student. Normally it is so, but not always.
But for learning, the Student obeys the Master in all things, as the
Master will not have the Student do something that will bring intended
harm to the Student.
 
Because of their love of knowledge, the Nephilim are Divine Masters. Their
knowledge and capability in battle has been unmatched since the demise
of The Enemy. Both strong of mind and body, these winged beings are a
force to be reckoned with.
~

0 agitation~
Syntax: cast agitation <target>
 
A devious power that uses the target's own body against them, agitation
causes the cells of a subject to vibrate and rub together, creating
tremendous friction, which sends the target into howing fits of pain,
burning them without flames. If you do not specify a target, the spell
will automatically target anyone you are currently in combat with.
~

0 levitation~
Syntax: cast levitation
 
Using their art to manipulate the forces about themselves, a Psionicist
can actually achieve limited flight, making it impossible to trip them,
and enabling them to get places that are normally shut off from non-fliers.
This power is for self-use only.
~

0 obfuscate~
Syntax: cast obfuscate
 
By projecting a special field of light about their bodies, a Psionicist
can disappear from sight altogether. As a powerful Psionicist once said,
"What your enemies cannot see hurts them more." This power is for self-
use only.
~

0 control_flame~
Syntax: cast 'control flame' <target>

Drawing flames from a light source, the {wcontrol flames{x spell causes
a tongue of fire to strike forth at a specified enemy. This spell does
require tht you have a light source on hand. If you do not specify a
target, the spell will automatically target the opponent you are currently
engaged in combat with.
~

0 adrenaline_control~
Syntax: cast 'adrenaline control'
 
Through concentration, a Psionicist can cause his adrenaline to flow on
command, increasing both his reflexes and endurance. The effects of this
power increase with the Psionicist's level. This power can only be 
self-cast.
~

0 inflict_pain~
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain' <target>
 
By forcing impulses into a target, a Psionicist can make a target's body
betray itself, making the opponent's mind believe he is in pain, and
making the subject's body erupt into wounds and bruied tissue. If you do
not specify a target the spell will automatically hit the opponent you
are currently in combat with.
~

0 domination~
Syntax: cast domination <target>
 
A Psionic may impress his own mental pattern over those of others,
overruling a target's ability to think and act. The Psionic may then
control the subject's body as its own, much like the Mage spell "charm."
~

0 apport~
Syntax: cast apport <target>
 
By way of translocation, a Psionicist can exchange the positions of living
things from great distances on an atomic level. Using this power, the
target is brought to the Psionic, exchanging a like amount of material
from what is surrounding it. Note tht the power of {wapport{x, like the
spell "summon," is not absolute, and there are some places that it cannot
reach.
~

0 psychic_crush~
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <target>
 
Another power that enters the mind of the target, Psychic Crush constricts
the thoughts and impulses of the enemy, wracking his mind with impulses
of literally being squashed into himself. If a target is not specified
for this power, it will automatically target whomever you are in combat
with.
~

0 thought_shield~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
 
With this power, the Psionicist creates a literal shield of force about
himself, opposing incoming attacks. This lowers one's armor class,
and the effect improves as the Psionicist's power grows. The Psionicist
may not use this power on others.
~

0 eidolon~
When the Angels fell prey to their lust for humans, they showed their first
sights of evil desires. They lusted for the bodies of these races, and as
a result the Nephilim were born. The Angels protected the race of their
children until one day they were cast from Heaven by God.
 
God took his vengeance out upon the Angels, and they fled. The Angels
became Archangels, with no home to return to. They could not return to
Heaven, for they were banned for all eternity. With no-where else to go,
the Angels fled to the underworld, to the deepest, darkest pits of hell
and death. The Angels' hatred for the Nephilim was fueled by the lost
souls and ghosts of Hades, and the Angels slowly began to warp and change
into creatures of the shadows. They evolved into cloaked, flying creatures.
 
They became The Eidolon.
 
The Eidolon are naturally translucent and can see all, whether it be day
or night. Their translucent nature also makes it hard to bash or trip them.
Since they are composed of all that is evil, negative energy and poisonous
diseases do not harm them. Their wisdom and intelligence is rivaled by
no other.
 
They live for one reason alone: Revenge.

            affecting you, including beneficial ones).
 
 
You can check to see how your conflags are set with the {wpcinfo{x command.

~

0 damage~
Damage is the reduction in hitpoints that you suffer as a result of
combat, spell effects, poison, and several other things. When you are
damaged, you will see a message like this:
 
{RThe {y(enemy's) (attack-type) (damage-type)s {Ryou for {y(#){R hp.{x
 
When you damage someone else, you will see a message like this:
 
{RYour {y(attack-type) (damage-type)s {Rthe {y(enemy){R for {y(#){R hp.{x
 
These combat messages tell you exactly who you are hitting or being hit
by, what you are hitting with (or being hit by), and exactly how much
damage in hitpoints is being dealt or received. Once either combatant
takes as much damage as they have in maximum hitpoints, they will be
killed.
 
Also see help for: DEATH, HITPOINTS
~

0 golden_aura~
Syntax: cast 'golden aura'
 
This spell surrounds the caster in a protective golden aura, reducing
the damage that he or she takes by 75%.
 
This spell cannot be used in conjunction with the {wsanctuary{x spell,
and can only be cast upon one's self.
~

0 aura_sight~
Syntax: cast 'aura sight' <target>
 
This ability taps into the mental energies of others to literally see
the colors of someone's soul. The Psionicist can then decipher the colors
to figure out the target's alignment. This is similar to the spell {wknow
{walignment{x.
~

0 lend_health~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <target>
 
One of the few healing devotions, through a methold known only to
Psionicists, this spell gives the caster the ability to heal others
using their own health. When this power is used, the Psionic will lose
health, with the target of the spell recovering an amount of health.
~

0 detonate~
Syntax: cast detonate <target>
 
Even more insidious than the power {wagitate{x, detonate causes cells
themselves to burst and die in large groups, in some cases igniting the
target with the intense friction required to cause this effect. If a
target is not specified for this power, it will automatically target
whomever you are in combat with.
~

0 cell_adjustment~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'
 
Using the same methods as {wpsychic healing{x, a Psionic can purge
venomous substances from the body. Using cell adjustment will cause the
Psionic's body to adapt and absorb the poison, channeling it away
harmlessly.
~

0 ballistic_attack~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <target>
 
With a simple force of will, the Psionicist can use its mind to hurl
small items from around itself toward its enemies. If a target is not
specified for this spell, it will automatically target any opponent the
Psionicist is currently in combat with.
~

0 mind_thrust~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust' <target>
 
One of the more insidious powers available to the Psionicist, {wmind thrust{x
invades the target's mind, overloading it with neural impulses and 
causing damage.
~

0 combat_mind~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'
 
With this power, a Psionicist may greatly increase the precision of
control over his own body, as well as his visual senses, allowing him
to evade and strike more accurately. While affected by {wcombat mind{x,
the Psionic enjoys a bonus to AC, hitroll, and damroll.
 
Also see help for: AC, DAMROLL, HITROLL
~

0 disintigrate~
Syntax: cast disintigrate <target>
 
A Psionic's most complex manipulation, {wdisintigrate{x is the power that
splits cells into their component parts, dissipated living beings into
vapor Curiousy, this awesome power is ineffective against all except
the soulless (eg monsters), but the result upon success is resolute and
final. Instant death. This spell may only be used to initiate combat,
and anything killed by disintigrate is truly GONE. Corpses and gear will
not be left behind.
~

0 forge~
Some great and powerful smiths are able to forge new properties into
weapons. Such services do not come cheaply, however, given the great
amount of time and magic involved.
 
{WThe following forges are available:{x
 
{CFLAME{x    : Adds a fire effect to your weapon, which increases the
           weapon's damage, as well as the chance that fire and smoke
           from the weapon will blind the enemy. Cannot be combined
           with the FROST forge.

{CDRAIN{x    : Makes a weapon vampiric, stealing the life force of
           those who it harms and returning strength to the wielder.
           Be warned, this process corrupts a weapon, and slowly will
           corrupt its' user, as well.

{CSHOCKING{x : Adds an electric effect to your weapon, which increases
           its damage and adds the possibility of stunning one's enemy.

{CFROST{x    : Adds a cold effect to your weapon, not only increasing
           its damage, but also may weaken one's enemy with the chill.
           This forge cannot be combined with the FLAME forge.

{CSHARP{x    : This forge hones the blade of piercing weapons, greatly
           increasing the amount of damage it can do.

{CVORPAL{x   : This forge hones the blade of slashing weapons, greatly
           increasing the amount of damage it can do.

{CPOISON{x   : Permanently coats a weapon with a sickly venom, which
           enters the bloodstream of any foe that it hits.
~

0 inertial_barrier~
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'
 
With this power the Psionicist creates a literal shield of force about
itself, opposing incoming attacks. This lowers the armor class of those
it affects, and the effect improves as the Psionicist gains power.
~

0 flesh_armor~
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
 
Yet one more of the manipulations of which a Psionic is capable is the
power of {wflesh armor{x. With this spell, a Psionicist can change the
makeup of their skin's cellular structure, making it has hard as steel
but still flexible. This power, in short, will reduce the Psionicist's
armor class.
~

0 dirt_kicking~
Syntax: dirt <target>
 
Considered by some to be a cowardly skill, {wdirt kicking{x gives the
clever combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into
his eyes. The resulting blindness does not last long, but can provide
an edge in combat. Dexterity helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.
 
Thieves, Assassins, Warriors, Anti-Paladins and Rangers may learn this
skill.
~

0 peek~
Syntax: peek <target>
 
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying
in their inventory, the better to ue the {wsteal{x command with. More
intelligent players and monsters are more difficult to {wpeek{x at. All
players may learn the peek skill, but Thieves are the most common
practitioners.
~

0 password~
Syntax: password <old> <new>
 
The {wpassword{x command changes your character's password. The first
argument you must give is your old (current) password, and the second
argument is your new password (what you would like to change it to).
 
It is recommended that you never, ever share your password with anyone else.
 
The password command is protected against being snooped or logged by an
Immortal.
~

0 lamia~
Curious creatures, origins unknown, the Lamia are a magical race much like
Centaurs, except instead of having the bottom halves of horses, the Lamia
have the fore- and hind-quarters of a lion and the upper body of a human.
Lamia are supernaturally quick and vigorous, and possess average strength
and mental ability. Lamia have an unnatural fear of fire, which, like
their origin, remains unexplained. Lamia make good Mages and Clerics and
are also competent Warriors and Assassins.
 
For more information on this race, type {cracestat lamia{x.
~

0 draconian~
Mockeries of the dragons of previous ages, the Draconian race are created
through the act of perverting and corrupting the eggs of dragons themselves.
They appear much like Lizardmen, but have wings and horns, features only
associated with their noble 'cousins.' Also like dragons, Draconians have
the unique ability to spit streams of the elemens at their foes in the
form of a breath weapon. The process of their creation is imperfect,
however, leaving them slow and inflexible, as well as a little muddled.
Draconians may become Warriors, Thieves, Assassins, Anti-Paladins, Mages,
Clerics, or Psionics.

0 breath_weapon aquire~
Syntax: aquire <breath type> <yourname>
 
The breath weapon is a unique ability given to the Draconian race. New
Draconians must choose the type of breath they wish to use when they
first join the world. Be sure to choose wisely, for once the choice is
made it cannot be changed later.
 
Use of the breath weapon begins at level 20.
 
Draconians may choose among the following breath weapons:
 
{cFIRE{x      {w<bfire>{x      Shoots liquid fire onto your foe.
 
{cACID{x      {w<bacid>{x      Projects a stream of corrosive acid.
 
{cLIGHTNING{x {w<blightning>{x Injures a foe with shocking spit.
 
{cGAS{x       {w<bgas>{x       Flings gaseous venom onto the enemy.

0 dodge~
In the words of one wise Warrior, "The best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands." The {wdodge{x skill honors this saying by improving
a character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss him.
The chance of dodging successfully is affected by the dexterity level of
both combatants.
 
Every class may learn the dodge skill.
 
Also see help for: PARRY

0 parry~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it! Parry is useful for deflecting
attacks, and is successful more often than dodge is. One must be wielding
a weapon in order to parry successfully. Those skilled in {whand-to-hand{x
combat may also see somewhat reduced damage from parrying, but will not
get the benefit of a full block. The best chance of parrying an attack
comes when the defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon

Once a player reaches 90% in each of the top scores(type: 'top' to see the

must complete a grand quest, this involves running The Gauntlet, and then
somthing different depending on if they pursue Nephilim(see:'help fallen')
or Eidolon (see: 'help eidolon'). 
Once they complete this quest they become either a 'Nephilim Legend' or an
'Eidolon Legend'

They lose everything at this point. Skills, Spells, Items, Quest Points,
Gold, everything. You do however get to pick a weapon choice, which will
start at 40%.

Legends cannot understand anything anyone says on any channel. In order to
undertand AND be understood, they need to purchase the racial languages.

language.

As a Legend you can buy ANY Spell or Skill with gold, quest points and

Every 5 levels of a legends life, they must complete a quest in order to
continue advancing. These quests involve collecting legednary shards and
joining them together to form a legendary item, this item will not be
revealed to you until you have joined all the shards together, which you
wont get the last shard untill level 99. Only legends can see and hold
these items and shards. And they can't complete or gather items for a
shard until they have reached the correct level. (i.e must be lvl 4 to
even be able to the level 4 shard.)

Being mortal enemies each legend type is vulnerable to attack from the
other, regardless of choose status. In essence you are auto-pk from
level 1. However, only legends can attack other legends.
