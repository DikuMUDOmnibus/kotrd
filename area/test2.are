The Bar~
You've entered a large bar, populated with all manner of creatures.  Some
look normal, and some must either be magical or alien in nature.  Many
tables dot the bar area, as well as stools along the bar.  A well made set
of stairs leads up to the few rooms John has built here for his frequent
customers.
