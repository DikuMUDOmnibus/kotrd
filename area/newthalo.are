A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon. An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.
The only obvious exit is to the north.

You are standing in the Sultan's tribute to the finer virtues. Large
paintings hang from the walls displaying nature scenes, nudes, and
glorious victories in battle. Strange scupltures rest on pedestals
at each corner of the room and mirrors are placed in strategic
locations so the viewer may see an entire sculpture at a glance. Your
eyes, however, are pulled towards a painting that dominates the far wall.

Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.

The Dragon Sea comes up along the shore here, the deep blue waters
rolling in and crashing against the beach.  To the north you see a small
dock jutting out into the surf.  To the west you see palm tress and what
seems to be a tropical beach.  A small bronze buoy, afloat only by magic,
bobs in the ocean.

{MOn a road{x~
The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide. One of these services is the construction crews
that go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher than other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.

but is still sturdy. A small ladder has been built on the eastern end
to allow easy access to and from ships.
