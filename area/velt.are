coldness of the air is comforting to him. He floats here more using more
magic than his wings, occasionally using his icy breath to plug holes
in his not so perfect illusion of clouds his magic has created.

{MSouth Wall{x~
The wall enters the southwest tower to the west and continues to the 
east. About forty feet south of the wall is the west end of the hold's
rampart. The rampart gradually slopes upwards as it approaches the
hold wall before making a sudden fifteen foot drop at its closest
point to the wall some forty feet away. The rampart prevents most 
siege machinery from reaching the walls, as it would surely topple.
The rampart provides no cover for attackers, as the height of the hold
walls allows them to shoot down on the attackers despite the slope of
the rampart.

You are at the top of the keep stairtower. To the east through three
stone arches is a door opening onto the hold wall. A stone slab is held
by chains between the first and second arches, above the door. Another
somewhat thinner stone slab is visible in a rectangular slot in the
floor between the second and third arches, and is being restrained by
two bolts. In the even the keep is under siege, the bolts are pulled,
and the heavier slab falls to block the doorway while the lighter slab
rises to block the doorway with yet another layer of stone. Once the
lighter slab clears the slot, eight iron bolts at a 45 degree angle
slide out of the slab, preventing it from going back into the floor.
To the west is a heavy iron door, while a small wood door is to the
south.

stone staircase flanked on either side by a bed of iron spikes leads
to a heavy iron door. A few feet above the door are a pair of stone
gargoyles, the stone about their open mouths pitted as if by acid.
Above this the stone that hangs out over the first floor of the keep
is marked by small ports, and you can see scratches and singe marks
on the wall below that tell of the fate of previous attackers. Higher
still, the wall continues, broken only by narrow vertical slits for
archers to fire down upon you. Atop it all are stone battlements with
embrasure shutters. You finally take time to notice a small sign in the
ground that says, "No Solicitors Allowed!".

{MOffice of Justice{x~
It is here that disputes between people of the hold and surrounding land
are settled. The small courtroom has areas set aside for the judge, and
representatives of the people, the accuser and the accused. Crude split
log benches line the stone walls, and the ever present portal awaits
to banish criminals. A door leads south to the town hall.

{MSeeker's Shrine{x~
This area holds a feeling of raw magical power so tangible you'd need
more than just a puny knife to cut it. Sounds from the bustling hold
just a few strides away do not reach this place, and you feel it
would be a good place to meditate. Trees and bushes surround this
small clearing, and a robed figure is sitting on one of the rocks
near its center. A path traveled by many pilgrims visiting the Seeker
makes its way back to Keep Road.

Small trees that make the wagon maker feel a bit less short line the

This room takes up most of the building and contains two huge looms
and a smaller one off to one side. Few households can afford the cost and
room a loom consumes, so looms are here for use by all. More often than
not, the use of the loom is paid for with an hour or two of extra weaving
work than money. Bolts of finished cloth are scattered about, as are
spools of thread and yarn. The road is back out the door to the west,
and archways lead south and east.

{MThe Water Tower{x~
The water tower is about 40 feet in diameter and a few stories high,
composed of stone at the base and wood higher up. A conical roof
drains rain water into the tower, but prevents water loss by
evaporation. A small waterwheel drives a belt that dips buckets into
a pool next to the moat and carries them to the top of the water
tower where they are tipped over by a small peg and dump their
contents onto the inverted cone roof. The waterwheel runs continously
and has no control mechanism, so a device was recently installed
to prevent the tower from flooding. A thick glass bottle is plugged
to keep air in and tied by a long rope to a gate near the bottom
of the tower. When the water level in the tower is too high, the
bottle floating at the top pulls on the rope and keeps the gate
open until the water level drops. The water tower is used during
droughts and sieges, its water tested regularly for poison.

{MDining Hall{x~
This long room is often rented out for parties or used by special 
guests. A blood red carpet covers the floor and matches the color of
the cushions on the chairs. The table is wide and long, with demihuman
leg bones that line the edge of the table and its legs. The bones have
been embossed with gold patterns of vines and thorns. On the east wall
a stately demon stands on a plateau looking down into a valley engulfed
in flames, which actually appear to be burning as you view the painting.
A mirror hangs on the west wall that doesn't show reflections of any
living being. Four demons carved from a deep black wood stand with their
feet planted near the top of each wall, their bodies leaning out over
the table and their hands interlocked with those of the adjacent 
demon to keep the group in their position arched above the table. 
In three places on the table, the bones of a demihuman hand reach
up out of a small chunk of cooled lava, fingers outspread for help
that never came. A red candle with an odd green flame burns on each
finger tip. Small bowls fashioned from demihuman skulls contain
dried and crushed garlic, tea leaves, strawberry leaves, barley,
and cinnamon. The common room of the inn is through the north door.

{MThe Black Market{x~
This small cavern was set aside as a marketplace. Here the criminals of
the underground can sell anything, no questions asked. Treasure and

This kitchen seems larger and better equipped than what a residence
this size would need. It has a stove large enough for a person to
climb into, a large table which appears to be used soley for preparing
meals, and a metal meat locker that must be magical to remain as cold
as it is. A small round window high in the wall lets in a bit of light.

This room is large and circular where it overhangs the southeast corner of
the keep. Stone machicolations have been mounted periodically in the floor,
allowing arrows, spears, and burning oil to be hurled at the attackers
at the entrance to the keep below. Archer's slits are present every few
feet of the wall, giving them a 270 degree field of fire. Each slit has
a closable shutter which protects adjacent archers when opened. Two
funnels near the east wall allow acid to be poured on those directly
before the door to the keep, and a covered hole in the middle of the
floor allows attack upon those just inside the keep. A ladder goes up
to the top of the keep.

into stone columns. In the east wall is a hole covered by a heavy iron
disk which the soldiers stick their spears through to gore enemies
in the entrance to the keep.

{MArtillery Platform{x~
This large stone platform forms the roof of the northwest corner of the
keep, to the east is the stairtower and to the south is a wall of the
keep on this level. The platform goes a few feet beyond the previous
level of the keep to the north and west, and has holes in the overhanging
portion to allow attacks to be made on those attempting to scale the
walls. The battlements are especially high in this area and have steps
near the edge of the platform that the archers must step up onto in 
able to be able to fire down onto attackers below. This is to protect
the catapult crews inside. Looking from southwest to north you see the
river that feeds the moat. The job of the soldiers here is to kill
anyone attempting to attack the hold from the river. A ladder leads
up to the ballista platform on the roof.

Here the alchemist produces the liquid death used against those who
would lay siege to the hold. Contact poison, potent acids, oils and 
even disease ridden slimes are either created or stored here, some going
to Zebo in payment for his aid in the keep's construction. A pair of stoves
are here for boiling liquids before they are cast down upon enemies. A
small peephole in the west wall has a curved mirror in it, allowing one
to view the entire west wall of the keep. Below this are a series of
small sinks, each with piping to a different section of the west wall, 
allowing the alchemist to efficiently kill attackers in relative safety
without running all over the keep. Doors exit the room to the east and
south.

a workbench for preparing spell components and beds for mages and
alchemist of the keep. The room has no windows, the only exit being

{MThe Ballista Turret{x~
The room is a technical masterpiece for its day and age. It consists of
an inner wood platform and an outer one floating in a deep pool of oily
water, all surrounded by a reinforced stone wall. On the inner platform
the ballista is mounted in a fixed position, and an iron ring is mounted
a few feet above the ballista on four posts. The ballista has a special
telescopic sight devised by Zebo and Simon. The outer platform has six
sets of iron posts mounted on it, and each of these has a triangular iron
plate attached to a hinge at the top, forming the roof. When it comes
time to fire, the dwarves that reload the ballista jump off the inner
platform and onto the outer one, causing the ballista's platform to
float higher and its iron ring to push the roof plates out of the way
so it has a clear field of fire. The ballista can be easily turned
because it is floating. After it has fired, the reloaders climb up 
onto the ballista platform, and the roof plates automatically close,
protecting them while they reload. The ballista is an important part of
the hold's defenses because it is used to sink ships at extreme ranges.
