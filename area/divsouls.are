A cartwheeling flurry slows momentarily to resolve itself into a slim,

The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

A middle rank assassin, the stalker has trained extensively in the
arts of death.  Increase in status up to this level has been obtained
by consent of the deathmaster, as the assassination of other clan
members while below this rank is cause for immediate death.  Rise in
rank for the stalker from now on will come only through the assassination
of one of higher rank.  Hence, the stalker seeks to hone his abilities
to perfection, for a failed assassination attempt means instant death,
and those above him are anything but strangers to the art.

mark gabrian white insignia hair~
an inscription is woven in gold around edge of the mark:

  Take my hand
  and fear no longer
  Take my hand
  and cry no more..

  Reaching into the icy darkness
  and for an instant
  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.
