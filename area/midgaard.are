As you gaze upon the statue of Arioch, you realize that this is the visage
of a God that just does not care about life and even less for goodness.
The whole of this statue appears to be constructed of a blackened steel and
stands many spans in height.  Large metalic wings jut from its back, while
a set of giant rams horns spiral out from either side of its head.  The only
other item of remark about this cold visage is the giant black and silver
two-handed sword that the statue is brandishing, as if waiting for the chance
to slay some foolish mortal that feels the Statue of a God would make a good
opponent...

lost treasures (cause lets be real, who would donate anything worth a ton of

This is the center meeting place and meditation area of the Temple.  All
around there are beautiful trees and flowers, marble benches and plush green
grass.  Priests and Priestesses can be seen going about their business or
chanting to themselves quietly under a large oak tree, none of them seems to
be disturbed by the number of people milling around here or sleeping (mostly
passing out) on the grass.  In the very center of the Courtyard is a large
marble slab that seems to be a map indicating what the various offices and

WooHoo!!  Party!!  This is the life, got a big new shiny sword, dad's
old, but well kept, breast plate and helm and a brand new dragon bag... 
What more could a tower of power, bad a$$, adventurer need?  Hmmmm....  Now
that the thought of what is needed to survive starts coming to mind, that
shiny sword does look a bit dull, and dad's armor was great, back in his
day...  **SIGH** ...  Well don't lose hope!!  By going UP and then NORTHWEST
from here the Midgaard Donation Room can be found, there can be found new,
well realitively new, EQ Donation Room awaits!  Many things can be found
there, like new (well relatively new anyway) swords, armor and general
survival gear; While UP and then to the NORTHEAST a Healer's Shrine is
located where it is rumored that newly starting out adventurers (sound
familiar?)  May recieve free healings and even a bless or two.  So live it
up!!  Run around and hack and slash every vicious fido you can find (only
good fido is a dead fido after all)...  And maybe, just maybe you'll live
long enough to grow up big and strong just like those Heros of Legend you
loved so much as a wet-behind-the-ears-baby-adventurer...

the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

{BThe Night Garden of Midgaard{x~
{DClothed alternately in moonlight and shadow, the famous Night Garden of
Midgaard lies before you.  Kept in a perpetual state of night by the gods
themselves, this incredible garden draws travellers from every corner of the
realm.  Originally planted by devotees of the Creators, the garden quickly
became a place for worshippers of all the gods to come in search of divine
inspiration.  For those that choose to worship more conventionally, a stone
temple is located to the south of the garden.  However, may other visitors
choose to enter and scatter to various places throughout this night shrouded
place.  As you enter the garden, you notice large groups gathered before
cascading waterfalls, with each waterfall comprised of one of the five
elements.  Having visited the Night Gardens before, you head for the less
well lit paths that lead deeper into garden, and which are complete with
cleverly situated nooks for those that wish to worship alone, and
undisturbed.  {x

their flames dancing on the walls, casting shadows.  There seems to be a
cool breeze flowing through here, but scanning around the room, you find no
doors or windows...  "Magic," you think to yourself.  Many sticks of incense
burn, filling the room with a scent that makes you want to sit and relax,
maybe take a little nap.  Welcome to the haven for all injured Thieves to
come and heal...

diff-fac~
*******************************************************************************************
For #34, you need/should undertand the following:
   
    DIFFICULTY FACTOR - For SKILLs the DIFF FAC is equal to the CP COST of the SKILL in
                        question (i.e. BERSERK has a cost of 5 CP for a WARRIOR, which 
                        means BERSERKs DIFF FAC is also 5).

                        For SPELLs the DIFF FAC was a number that has never been shown to
                        the PCs or ANYONE that did not go into the CODE directly, but 
                        this number was usually pretty low (1-2 in 99% of the cases).

                        The HIGHER the DIFFICULTY FACTOR, the HARDER/MORE DIFFICULT the 
                        SKILL/SPELL is.  DIFF FACs range from 1 to 20 (sometimes even 
                        more).

                        Now, what the CODE does with the DIFFICULTY FACTOR of the 
                        respective SKILL/SPELL is as follows:

                           a) Whenever the PC is PRACTICing a SKILL/SPELL (i.e. when you
                              type 'PRAC <SKILL or SPELL NAME>' at a GUILDMASTER) the 
                              DIFF FAC determines the NUMBER of % (Percentage Points) to
                              ADD to the respective SKILL/SPELL.).  The HIGHER the DIFF
                              FAC the LESS that is added to the SKILL/SPELL per PRAC POINT
                              spent.
                  
                           b) Whenever the PC SUCCESSFULLY uses a SKILL or CASTs a SPELL,
                              the DIFF FAC is used to determine IF the PC's Skill % (Skill
                              Percentage) IMPROVEs.  The HIGHER the DIFF FAC the HARDER or 
                              MORE DIFFICULT it is to IMPROVE with the SKILL/SPELL through
                              use.
*******************************************************************************************

34) MANY (most) of the current SPELLs DIFFICULTY FACTORs have been raised.  The reason is
    because almost 99% of ALL of the SPELLs in the MUD had a DIFF FAC no higher than 2,
    which is NOT fair to the CLASSes that are more SKILL based AND because this did not 
    make any sense that SPELLs were so easy to LEARN/IMPROVE.  The DIFF FAC was not raised
    a HUGE amount, it was only raised enough to reflect how HARD/DIFFICULT the SPELL truly
    is (You can see the DIFF FAC of ANY SPELL/SKILL based on CLASS by using SLOOKUP (see #8
    above for how this COMMAND is used)) or to atleast bring them up to PAR with the rest 
    of the SKILLs in KotRD.  (You'll also notice, using SLOOKUP, that the HIGHER the level
    of the SPELL, the HIGHER the DIFF FAC.  Since a HIGH level SPELL would be much MORE 
    DIFFICULT to LEARN/IMPROVE at).

    {G*** {cType {D'{WLOOK DIFF-FAC{D'{c for an explanation of {CDIFFICULTY FACTOR {G***{x
 
35) The SPELL 'CURSE' has had some slight modifications so that it will actually be
    a detrimental spell to the OPPONENT.
 
36) The CODE for SAVing vs. SPELLs has been revamped.  The chance to save vs. SPELLs
    should now generate a truer chance as there was a small BUG and a small problem
    with the original FORMULA for calculating MOB and PC SAVEs.
 
37) SPELL-CASTERs that are able to use the CHARM <MOB or CHARACTER> spells can now have
    upto three ( 3 ) MOBs under their INFLUENCE at a time.
 
    {G*** {WONLY{c MAGEs & PSIONICs can have more than 1 PET since they are trained to be
    {G*** {cable to MANIPULATE and USE the high amount of ENERGIEs required to do this.

    {G*** {cAlso CHARM now does an INTELLIGENCE check against the VICTIM.  If the TARGETs
    {G*** {cINT is GREATER THAN the CASTERs INT+2 the TARGET will NOT be CHARMed.{x 

38) CHAR ALIGNMENTs are now STATIC!!!  That means the ALIGN you pick when you make your
    CHARACTER is the ALIGNMENT your character WILL REMAIN FOREVER!!!  So choose carefully!
 
    {G** {cAll current players will get their {WALIGNMENT{c AUTO-SET by the code based on
    {G** {cthe CHARACTERs CURRENT {WALIGNMENT{c.  The {WVALUE{c that gets set is based on

    {c   {cSET with an ALIGN of 0 (NEUTRAL)
{x

dt06~
28) The commands YELL and WHERE are no longer available WHEN and ONLY WHEN your CHARACTER
    is in ANY (including their own) CLAN HALL.
 
29) The CODE for PETs, CHARMIEs, ZOMBIEs, etc... (basically any part of the CODE that 
    allows the PC to have a PET) has been re-CODEd.  I found a BUG that would sometimes
    keep PETs from being able to DIE or that would prevent OPPONENTs from being able to
    ATTACK a pet.  This has been fixed.

30) The NEW TOGGLABLE command 'NORESTORE' has been added.  What this does (if the PC has
    it turned ON) is makes the IMMORTAL power 'RESTORE' not function on the PC.  Before
    you think 'I would NEVER turn that on' let me enlighten you about this...

    The IMMORTAL power 'RESTORE' has been MODIFIED.  Now RESTORE (If it is the type of 
    RESTORE that not only HEALs you but also casts 'SANCTUARY' and/or 'HASTE' on the 
    target) will strip ALL effects from your CHARACTER, regardless of level AND regardless
    if the effect was a BENEFIT or a DETRIMENT AND then place 'SANCTUARY' and/or 'HASTE'
    upon you.  The type of RESTORE that ONLY HEALs you does not do this.

    Due to the above change to RESTORE is why the NORESTORE toggle has been added, since
    not everyone would want/like to lose ALL of their POWER UPs.

31) When the PLAYER types SKILLS or SPELLS (the commands used to view what SKILLs/SPELLs
    the PC currently has and at what level) they will now show both the PC's current SKILLs
    and SPELLs for their CURRENT class AND if the PC is a REMORT, they
    will show the SKILLs/SPELLs from the REMORTs PREVIOUS class.

32) If you flag yourself AFK and enter a KEYSTROKE (i.e. A KEYSTROKE is when you have your
    CHARACTER do something like MOVE, ATTACK, CAST, etc...) the AFK flag will now be 
    removed from your CHARACTER.

33) MANY of the SKILLs/SPELLs levels have been CHANGed/UPDATED 'to reflect/based on' the
    NEW additions to the CODE or because they were not of the right LEVEL to begin with.

~
E
dt05~
22) The SKILL 'SPELLCRAFT' has been removed from the following classes:
      PSIONIC
    PSIONIC's are NOT spell casters.  They will possibly be getting a similar type 
    SKILL later that is more appropriate to what they do.

23) The SKILL 'QUICKEN' has been removed from the following classes:
      RANGER

    This was a mistake on my part that I am now fixing.  QUICKEN was made to be a THIEF
    only skill.

24) The SPELL 'DIVINE WRATH' has been added to the SPELL GROUP of the following classes:
      PALADIN at 85th LEVEL.

    No reason they would not have this.

25) A NEW command called 'JUNK' has been added.  By typing:
             'JUNK <TARGET ITEM in YOUR INVENTORY>' 
    (i.e. JUNK DAGGER) you are now able to get rid of EQ without having to DONATE and/or
    drop it and then SACRAFICE it.  JUNKing and ITEM does NOT give you SILVER as SACRAFICE
    did, it just gets rid of the ITEM.  The ONLY restriction so far to this command is that
    the TARGET ITEM can not be flagged NO_DROP, NO_PURGE or FORTIFIED.

26) The command AUTOLIST has been removed AND the CHANNEL list has been modified.  Alot of
    the PC info that was available by using these two (2) commands has been moved to the
    NEW command PCINFO.  PCINFO also shows a couple of NEW things that it didn't before.

27) There was a BUG in how the CODE checked for a PC's or MOB's RESISTANCEs, 
    basically, the CODE was not giving ANY BENEFITs (reduced damage) to MOBs or
    PCs that had RESISTANCEs.  This has now been fixed.  IF the PC or the MOB 
    is/has the appropriate RESISTANCE to an ATTACK form used against them, they
    will ONLY take HALF ( 1/2 ) damage now.

~
E
dt04~
18) The SKILL 'ENHANCED DAMAGE' has been removed from the following classes:
      THIEF

    This is because THIEVEs already have two (2) other SKILLs that ENHANCE their 
    damage (CIRCLE and BACKSTAB) AND because this represents the CHARACTERs knowledge
    of finding WEAK/VULNERABLE AREAs in thier OPPONENTs, something a THIEF would NOT
    be concerned with as they are NOT supposed to be a COMBAT oriented class AND 
    because of this, they would/should not be trying to spend that much time in direct
    COMBAT.  Remember, a THIEF STEALs by using PICK POCKET, CAT BURGLARY, etc... not
    by KILLing their OPPONENT.

19) The SKILL 'FAST HEALING' has been made available to the following classes at the
    listed levels:
      MAGE at 50th LEVEL.

    This is because a MAGE needs to have studied HERBs and such to be able to cast or 
    create some SPELLs.  Due to this knowledge, a MAGE would also know what HERBs/HERBAL
    remedies would help the healing process (even if it is only a slight amount).

20) The SKILL 'HIDE' has been removed from the following classes:
      WARRIOR

    Warriors would be spending more time learning to kill their OPPONENT than they 
    would be learning to HIDE from it.

21) The SKILL 'PEEK' has been removed from the following classes:
      ASSASSIN

    No reason for an ASSASSIN to be able to discern what someone is carrying hidden 
    about their body since if the person has come under the attention of the ASSASSIN
    there can usually only be one (1) reason, thier death!  Also this skill would or 
    should have been THIEF only since they are really the only ones that would use it
    (Like in conjunction with the SKILL 'STEAL').      

~
E
dt03~
12) A NEW REMORT Class called ENCHANTER has been added.  This class has a lot 
   of NEW SPELLs that are ONLY available to members of this class.

13) The MOB combat CODE was VERY messed up (when I re-wrote alot of the COMBAT
    CODE I was paying attention more to the CODE that directly affected the PLAYERs
    more than I did to the MOB CODE).  This has been fixed now. (The biggest change
    or fix was that MOBs were not getting their +DAMROLL added to the damage they 
    did whereas the PCs were).

14) The SKILL 'SCROLL' has been removed from the following classes:
      THIEF, ASSASSIN, WARRIOR and RANGER

    The reason for this is that these classes could not/should not have been able to
    READ magical writtings since they are not/have not been trained in HOW to read it.
    This also makes the SPELL CASTing classes a bit more UNIQUE and also BALANCEs the
    face that they have been given WEAPON RESTRICTIONs.

15) The SKILLs 'WAND' and 'STAFF' have been removed from the following classes:
      THIEF, ASSASSIN, WARRIOR, RANGER, PALADIN and ANTI-PALADIN

    For almost the same reasons as #14.  Basically there is no logical REASON and/or
    WAY that these classes would and/or should be able to INVOKE the MAGIC stored 
    within either of these two item types.

16) The SKILL 'EXOTIC' has been made available to the following classes at the listed
    levels:
      PALADIN, RANGER and ANTI-PALADIN at 95th LEVEL.

17) The SKILL 'PARRY' has been removed from the following classes:
      MAGE, CLERIC, PSIONIC and THIEF

    This is because the SKILL to PARRY an OPPONENTs weapon and/or attack is a SKILL 
    that is VERY difficult to learn and VERY time consuming to learn.  These classes 
    would be spending more time learning the SKILLs/SPELLs appropriate to their 
    respective CLASSes.

~
E
dt02~
8) Added RACIAL and CLASS LANGUAGEs.  These are AUTOMATICALLY given to the 
   appropriate classes/races and are used just like SAY.  (i.e. to speak in
   DWARVEN so only other DWARFs can understand you, you would type: 
   DWARVEN <THE TEXT YOU WISH TO SAY>)

   There is no LEARNing of LANGUAGEs that are not specific to your RACE/CLASS.
   (i.e. An Elf can't learn DWARVEN)

   RACIAL LANGUAGEs are lost when a PC REMORTs, CLASS LANGUAGEs are retained.

   The LANGUAGEs that go with what CLASSes/RACEs are shown in RACESTAT and
   CLASSTAT.

9) AUCTIONs may only be STARTed within the MIDGAARD AUCTION HALL.  The 
   same applies to BIDDing on ITEMs.

   AUCTIONs are shown to ALL PCs that have the AUCTION CHANNEL turned on.

   AUCTION INFO will work anywhere within the MUD.

10) A command called SLOOKUP has been added.  By typing: 
             'SLOOKUP <SKILL or SPELL NAME>' 
   you can get some basic INFORMATION on ANY SPELL/SKILL available to 
   Mortal-PCs in the MUD.
   IMMORTALs that have been EMPOWERED with SLOOKUP get a bit MORE INFO than 
   the normal SLOOKUP.

11) OTHO has been removed.  You can now CHANGE your SILVER into GOLD at your 
    respective banks. (For ALL but THIEVEs and ASSASSINs you goto the BANK of
    MIDGAARD.  THIEVEs and ASSASSINs have to go to their GUILD TREASURY which
    is located within the  THIEVES/ASSASSINs guild.

~
E
dt01~
1) GAIN CONVERT will allow PCs to turn 2000 Quest Points into 1 TRAIN 
 
2) When a PC dies now (not in DRAGONPIT) they will LOSE 1 CONSTITUTION 
   point.

   If the PC's CON ever reaches 1 or LESS, the CHARACTER will no longer 
   be able to login, as the PC's Spirit has gone to a better place.  
   (There is only so much even MOTA can do)

   CON may still be TRAINed as normal at the PC's respective GUILDMASTER
   or at a TRAINER.

3) GROUP and FOLLOW will NOT work in the DragonPit AND if the PC is GROUPed or is 
   FOLLOWing or being FOLLOWed when they JOIN a DragonPit, this also will be removed.

4) PCs may NO longer DONATE EQ that is 31st LEVEL or ABOVE. (Donation is 
   meant to help low levelers/newbies, plus, what PERSON would be donating
   or giving away SUPER EQ?)

5) MOBs killed within KotRD now have a 1 in 15 chance of their SPIRIT returning
   from the Realm of the Dead in an attempt to avenge their MURDER!!

6) Several STOCK ROM BUGs have been patched and/or fixed. (Memory Leaks, 
   Character Listing, etc...)

7) The THIEVEs and ASSASSINs GUILD Houses are now in the SAME building.  
    (Their location is where the ORIGINAL THIEVEs Guild has always been)

Just a last couple of things about the DragonPIT you might want to know:
 
   a) SUMMON and CHANT will not work while you are a combatant.  The
      DragonLord feels that if you are using PETs to fight for you
      that you are not fighting within the Spirit of what the DragonPIT
      stands for.  It is to see how you as an INDIVIDUAL compare to your
      fellow adventurers or, to put it bluntly, to see if you can 
      kick your buddies A$$ ....
 
   b) TRACK has also been disabled while in the DragonPIT.  And it is
      understood that TRACK is a skill of the Ranger and that some
      will think that they should be allowed to use it while in the
      DragonPIT, WELL...  It has been disabled for a couple of major
      reasons which are:
 
    1) Rangers are Woodsmen/Outdoor types, the DragonPIT is an underground
       OTHER dimensional area hence, the Ranger would be unable to use his
       or her skills of following animal tracks and looking for broken twigs.
 
    2) The DragonPIT is supposed to be a kind of Maze, so because of this, 
       Track had to be disabled or it would have been very over-balancing
       possibly causing for the DragonPIT to not be as fun when Rangers join
       it since they can locate their target and gets directions that will
       lead them directly to their target.
 
As other things get thought up/added to the DragonPIT, we will try and post it here
immediately in the appropriate section of the DragonPIT Information.  If you are
unclear on anything or have a question about the DragonPIT that was not covered in
{RDP01{x, {RDP06{x, {RDP10{x, {RDP11{x or {RDP12{xthen you can try sending a note to
Argon and he will try to get back to you with an answer as soon as he can.
~
E
dp12~
When the DragonPIT launches the Battle, everyone that was in the DragonPIT 
Starting Room will be RANDOMLY scattered around the DragonPIT.  When this 
happens the DragonPIT has begun and it is time to kill or be killed.
 
The DragonPIT area is a 45 room area that has been put together to be a 
slight maze.  You will need to run around here to find your opponents, or 
to try and run from/hide from them.
 
Anyone can engage anyone else that has joined the DragonPIT.  PKillers can
attack NON-PKillers, NON-PKillers can attack NON-PKillers, 100th level PCs 
can attack 5th level PCs.  Basically, if you have joined the DragonPIT you 
are now FAIR game to anyone that can find you.
 
While the DragonPIT is going on the DragonLord will give regular updates 
on how much time is remaining in the current Battle.  He will also announce 
when someone gets ELIMINATED from the Battle and who it was that took them 
out.
 
While you are a combatant of the DragonPIT, you will lose NO EXPERIENCE and 
NO CONSTITUTION POINT for death. You also DO NOT lose ANY EXP for fleeing 
and any DEATHS you might suffer while in the DragonPIT do NOT count against
any PK-Records. 
 
If and When you do suffer a death in the DragonPIT, you will automatically
get transported to the DragonPIT Return Room.  NO corpse is generated by 
dying in a DragonPIT, so there is no chance of someone looting it either.  
You just appear in the Return Room with all your EQ still in place.

The WINNER of the DRAGONPIT also receives both the JACKPOT (-10% for the 
DragonLord's expenses) AND a FULL RESTORE!
~
E
dp11~
If you are able to join and decide to do so, you will be transported to the
DragonPIT Starting Room.  Everyone that joins the DragonPIT gets put in this
room prior to the actual start of the DragonPIT.  Within this room a couple
of things happen:

   a) Upon your arrival you will be completely RESTORED back to full
      HEALTH and MANA so that everyone will start the DragonPIT fresh.
 
   b) Also upon your arrival, ANY and ALL spell affects that you were
      under the influence of will be DISPELLED, this also is to allow
      everyone to start fresh and even.
 
   c) You will be UNABLE to cast ANY spell or start ANY form of physical
      combat while in this room.
 
   d) You also will be UNABLE to eat PILLS or quaff POTIONS.
 
   e) Many non-combat/non-spell oriented skills have also been disabled
      while here.  I am not going to list them all, but they are basically
      ANY skill that might give you a starting advantage over your opponents.
      If any of these types of skills are found to be usable in this room,
      please NOTE ARIOCH with the name of the missed skill so it can be
      added.
 
One tick before the actual DragonPIT starts the DragonLord will announce 
that the current DragonPIT is now CLOSED and that the battle will begin 
within one ( 1 ) tick.
~
E
dp10~
When you see an DRAGONPIT start, you have 4 ticks to decide if you want to join
it.  Just because an DragonPIT has been started does not mean you will be able to
participate in it.
 
The DragonLord will announce when an DRAGONPIT is starting.  Watch what he says
in his announcement to see if you can/want to join the upcoming DragonPIT.  He
will always announce the following information every tick (4) until the DragonPIT
CLOSES to new combatants:
 
  a) The DRAGONPIT TYPE.  Either FREE-FOR-ALL (which is every man and woman for
     themselves) or TEAM BATTLE (the combatants fight as a team, or CLAN,
     against an opposing team).

  b) The LEVEL RANGE.  This is variable and based on what the Imm/Imp that
     starts it wants.  The range can be from 1st to 100th or any other combo
     that the Imm/Imp wants. (i.e. 35th lvl to 55th, 32nd to 78th, etc...).

** If you are NOT within the range for the DragonPIT, you will be unable to join. **
 
  c) The ENTRY FEE. This is the amount of GOLD pieces that you must
     pay FOR EACH LEVEL OF YOUR CHARACTER.  What this means is, if the
     Entry Fee was 5gp per level and you were 100th level, it would cost
     you 500 GOLD PIECES to join the DragonPIT (5 * 100 = 500).
 
  d) The Current Number of Combatants that have already joined the DragonPIT.
 
  e) The Number of Ticks left to join that DragonPIT before it is CLOSED
~
E
dp06~
These are the current commands available to you having to do with DRAGONPITs :
 
DRAGONPIT - This is the command you use to JOIN a currently running and open
            DragonPIT.  If you see the DragonLord announce that one is about 
            to start, you have 4 ticks to decide if you want to join it and 
            then to do so, you must type this command.  (i.e.  If an Imm/Imp
            has started a DragonPIT and it is not yet closed (see DRAGONPIT 
            STATS below for info on CLOSED DRAGONPITs) you must type: 
              
                                {RDRAGONPIT{x 

            you will then be transported to the DragonPIT Starting Room
            where you will wait with the other contestants for it to begin.)
 
DPTALK - This is the command you use to talk over the DRAGONPIT CHANNEL.  The
         only time you can communicate over this channel is if you are PARTIC-
         IPATING in a currently running DragonPIT.  Everyone that has the
         channel turned on can see what is being said on it, but only those 
         in the DragonPIT can use it.  Since the DragonLord uses this channel
         to announce when one is starting up, if you have this channel turned
         OFF you will not know when one is starting, nor will you be able to
         join one.

 {G*** {xTo Turn {ROFF{x DRAGONPIT CHANNEL type DPTALK and nothing else {G***{x
 
DRAGONPIT STATS - This is a sub command of DRAGONPIT, if you type DRAGONPIT 
                  and the word STATS on the same line (i.e. DRAGONPIT STATS) 
                  you will be shown the current status of the DragonPIT. You
                  can type/use this at anytime, even if no DragonPIT is running.  
                  
                  This displays info on the DRAGONPIT, running or not.  Here you
      		  can see if a currently running DragonPIT has been closed to new
                  members, the # of combatants in the DragonPIT, the current Jackpot,
                  and much more...
 
WHO DRAGONPIT - By typing WHO with the argument DRAGONPIT you will be shown the 
                names of the combatants that are still fighting in the currently
                running DragonPIT.
 
As new COMMANDs get added for use with the DRAGONPIT, they will be posted here.  
So check here as often as you like, you might learn something new that will give 
you an edge in your next DRAGONPIT.....

Below are the things you should know about the DRAGONPIT so that you can
participate in them and more fully enjoy them.  If you still have some
questions about the DRAGONPIT after reading this, or if something here is
unclear, you can send a NOTE to Arioch or IMP and we will try to respond as 
soon as we can.
 
1) DRAGONPITs can only be started by an Immortal that has been EMPOWERED with
   a special command that allows them to do so.  Since not every Imm has this
   command, we ask that you refrain from asking every Imm you see if they will
   start a DragonPIT for you.  (See #2 for more on requesting DragonPITs)
 
2) Do NOT nag, whine, pester, annoy, etc... Immortals about running a DragonPIT.
   We want you to enjoy the DragonPIT and to be able to play in them as often as
   possible, but with so many players coming and going on the MUD, if each of
   you asked just one time if we are going to run a DragonPIT that would be alot
   of TELL, CHAT, NOTE spam that that unlucky Immortal will be getting.  If 
   an Imm capable of starting a DragonPIT is on AND they want to start one for
   everyone, they probably will.  We do not want to run too many of them all
   the time, as we would like to keep DragonPITs as something special/kewl that
   an Immortal can do for the Mortals to add a little spice to the game.
 
   If you ignore this request and start bugging Immortals/Implementors all
   the time to run one, YOU will have the command taken away from you for
   an indefinate period of time.  What this means is, you will not be able
   to join ANY DragonPITs that are run until the Imms/Imps think you are able
   follow the rules about the DragonPIT.
 
Other Rules maybe added here as needed so you may want to check here every
once in a while to see if anything has changed.  Just as a warning, if a
rule you have violated/broken is posted here but you did not know about
it because you did not check back here, you will still be dealt with as
if you did know the rule existed, so please do not try and use the plea
of 'I didn't know about that rule!', not coming here to check up on ANY
of the rules posted in this room is not a valid excuse to break them.

Harrassment is anything that is upsetting your fellow player that you are doing, this means:
1) Casting spells on them that are not useful(except in combat with them) or if unasked.
2) Spamming them with TELLS insulting them or if they ask you to stop sending them TELLs.
3) ANY type of Sexual Harrassment.
4) Anything else that would/could be considered harrassment.  
 
If you would not like it done to your character (or done to you in RL) do not do it to
someone else.  Common Sense is the key here, use it.

{G**Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of {RALL{G of your CHANNEL privs.{x
 
{C[{WCHAT{C]{x - No cussing, no flaming of players.  Do {RNOT{x use a PET or CHARMED MOB
to chat anything you as a player are not allowed to chat.  This channel should only be 
used for NON-GAME conversations (hence CHAT channel), such as saying hello, talking about 
football,etc... ANYTHING having to do with GAME PLAY (unless you are speaking to an IMM 
or IMP) is a BIG NO!!  This means, {RDO NOT CHAT THE FOLLOWING OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO
SIMILAR{x:

 1) No asking for EQ to be auctioned.

 2) No asking for or giving directions to ANYWHERE. 

 3) No asking for SPELLs to be cast on you.

 4) No asking the IMMs/IMPs for SPELLs, RESTOREs, GAME INFO, HELP, etc...

 5) No asking for players to join a group you are in or are forming. (Use TELLs)

Basically, use your common sense, if you THINK it COULD be offensive to ANYONE (no 
matter  how trivial it may seem to you)or IF it has ANYTHING to do with the MUD 
(unless you are speaking to an IMM or IMP about something) it does not belong on 
CHAT ...
 
{b[{WVENT{b]{x - You can say just about anything to anyone on this channel, you can 
cuss, you can flame other players (Mortals may flame Mortals, if you feel the need 
to flame an Immortal, use TELL or send them a note but be warned, flaming an IMM or 
an IMP can get you in DEEP TROUBLE unless it is justified, like they are slaying you 
over and over, transing you all over the MUD, etc... and if this is happening, your
best corse of action should be to send a NOTE to the IMPs).  Other than that, just 
about anything goes.
 
{g[{WCLAN{g]{x - This is used to talk to fellow clan members.  Only members of your
own clan can see what is said here.  Your Clan Immortal will tell you what is and 
isn't OK to say here.
 
{R[{WCWAR{R]{x - This is seen by all players that are members of a CLAN.  It is used
to boast about your clan, flame other clans, etc... You can cuss here but do not get 
real Personal.  If you have a personal problem with someone send a note or use a tell.
Other than this, almost anything goes here as well.
 
{m[{WRolePlay{m]{x - This channel is for ROLEPLAYING only.  Do not use it for anything
other than to RP.  If you are not going to RP here, the best thing to do is turn this
channel off.  Do not flame/slam/pick on ANYONE if they are trying to RP.  Once more, if
you do not plan to RP here you should turn this channel off to save yourself any possible
problem that might happen.  Also, RolePlaying does not mean asking for DIRs somewhere or 
any of the other NOs listed under the Rules for the Chat Channel above.

{D[{RDragonPIT{D]{x - See the INFO listing for the DRAGONPIT for INFO on this CHANNEL.

Immortals should NEVER flame a mortal on a public channel, if this happens to you please
note Lybre, Pyros or Arioch.  
 
Mortals should NEVER flame Immortals on a public channel.  This can get you into serious
trouble.
